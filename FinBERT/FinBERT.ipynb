      "Bitcoin and ether momentum stalled this week as investors fretted first about vibrant jobs data and continued U.S. central bank hawkishness, and then about the potential for increased crypto regulation. Kraken’s agreement to sunset liquidity staking services for U.S. customers particularly darkened the market mood late Thursday.Bitcoin and ether dropped 6.8% and 7.3% over the last seven days, respectively, losing a sizable chunk of their gains from the first five weeks of 2023. Both are now up about 30% year to date – spearheads in a wider crypto revival – although this week’s declines supported a number of analysts who have predicted that bitcoin support will sink to the $20,000 level.The week also marked cryptos’ decoupling from traditional finance indexes, with the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 falling more than 50%. Many leading digital assets spent much of the week in the red.Top performersAmong the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, only Polygon's MATIC finished the week in positive territory. BTC and ETH ranked sixth and ninth, respectively.Solana (SOL) and avalanche (AVAX) were the weekly laggards, with both down more than 15%. The large number of declining assets sharply contrasts to the prior week, when 16 of the 20 assets finished higher.While the macro narrative has dominated crypto markets for much of 2023, industry-specific developments assumed center stage starting late Wednesday and culminating Thursday with Kraken’s agreement to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges that its staking services for U.S. retail investors amounted to offering unregistered securities. Along with halting the offering, Kraken will pay a $30 million fine.SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s warning for crypto companies to “take note” and “fall into compliance” following the Kraken announcement presented a larger, long-reaching overhang for the industry. The statement clearly signaled the SEC will be stepping up its crypto regulatory efforts.The risks to crypto markets appear to be shifting from all-encompassing systematic risk to sector-specific nonsystematic risk, and investors should monitor the flow of coins to and from exchanges for bullish and bearish signals.The Exchange Net Position change for BTC has been negative this week, implying that investors are transferring coins from exchanges into storage (bullish). A shift in this trend, however, would indicate that investors are becoming leery of BTC’s immediate prospects and sending coins to exchanges to be sold (bearish).Kraken's settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its liquid staking platform spurred a market decline, with the impact felt most by futures traders betting on further growth.Long trades, or bets on higher prices, took 90% of the $220 million in liquidations on crypto futures trading over the past 24 hours as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) fell nearly 5%. Bitcoin and ether futures cumulatively saw $100 million in liquidations, while futures tracking dogecoin (DOGE), solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and aptos (APT) took on $4 million in liquidations apiece.That's the highest level of liquidations since November for long traders, or those who hold the security directly. Crypto exchange Binance took over $95 million in liquidations, the most among counterparties, with OKX taking $47 million.Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position owing to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is when they don't have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.Liquidations data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.Kraken agreed to “immediately” end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and pay $30 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges it offered unregistered securities.Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin swung below $22K after crypto exchange Kraken agreed to sunset its crypto staking operations; altcoins fell, although liquid staking tokens were an exception.Insights: Whales are sending bitcoin back to exchanges, while retail investors are removing the asset. What could the trend mean?A Kraken Settlement, Fresh Regulatory Concerns and a Crypto DeclineSo much for $24,000. Or $23,000.Over a 24-hour period that raised fresh concerns about the future of crypto regulation, bitcoin tumbled to $21,827, a more than 5% drop that sent the largest cryptocurrency to its lowest level in about two weeks. Much of the decline came after crypto exchange Kraken agreed to “immediately” end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and pay $30 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges it offered unregistered securities.“Today’s action should make clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair and truthful disclosure and investor protection,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said of the settlement.In an interview with CoinDesk TV, Brett Sifling, an investment adviser at wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki, highlighted the need for improved regulation to help \"crypto truly to go to the next level.\"\"Innovation has outpaced the legislation that our government has put forward,\" Sifling said. \"We need some blood, some sign of trust that our government is going to back us and that there isn't just going to be the Wild West out there with a bunch of criminals in the industry, because it ultimately hurts the common person.\"He added: \"If we want wide-scale adoption, we need to have these rules in place so that we can ultimately build and have confidence putting investments into the market and knowing that they're not gonna disappear one day when you wake up.\"Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, behaved similarly, dropping from its previous support comfortably above $1,600 to about $1,546, a 6.6% decline from Wednesday same time, that was part of a wider market downswing. The drop-off after a five-week spike began after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted Wednesday that his firm had heard rumors the SEC wanted to ban retail investors from engaging in crypto staking, the income-generating technique at the core of running blockchains including Ethereum.Most other cryptos spent the day in solidly negative territory, although liquidity staking tokens were exceptions as LDO, the governance token of Lido Finance, the largest liquid staking protocol with some $8.4 billion of staked ether (ETH) on the platform, jumping 10.4% in an hour at one point. LDO was more recently up about 2%. LDO competitor Rocket Pool’s RPL and smaller liquid staking platform’s tokens such as Persistence’s pSTAKE and StaFi’s FIS all rose handsomely in the aftermath of the Kraken announcement.Equity markets unaffected by the crypto news fell more gently with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, each dropping about 1%. Investors had sent stocks higher earlier in the day after an encouraging increase in weekly jobless claims suggested that the hot job market might finally be cooling and that the U.S. central bank's monetary aggressiveness was working to staunch inflation. Job figures have remained stubbornly positive for months even as other indicators have suggested an economic contraction that historically leads to lower prices.Gerber Kawasaki's Sifling was cautiously optimistic about crypto's path ahead, noting that bitcoin had been trading in a narrow range for months. \"Crypto has had a great run this year. Inflation is decelerating. The macro factors are improving. But it's still really been range bound, since August. I wouldn't get too excited yet until we come out of this range.\"Whale Investors Sending More Bitcoin to ExchangesBitcoin “whales,” investors who hold over 1,000 BTC, are beginning to move bitcoin back onto centralized exchanges.The trend comes even as on-chain activity shows that smaller investors are removing BTC from exchanges.As coin movement from exchanges is generally bullish, while the opposite is bearish, one interpretation is that both larger and smaller investors are wrong about which way the market is headed with the former too downcast and the latter overly optimistic.The other interpretation, however, is that whales are simply managing their downside risk because they have more to potentially lose. Regardless, many market observers will likely continue to eye the trend.3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) United Kingdom Gross Domestic Product (QoQ)9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Canada Net Change in Employment (Jan) 11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (Feb) In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Exchange LocalBitcoins to Close; Hermès Wins Trademark Lawsuit Against MetaBirkins NFTsBitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins is set to discontinue its service this month in response to the \"ongoing very cold crypto winter.\" Okcoin Chief Operating Officer Jason Lau shared his crypto markets analysis.

The higher figure represents the first increase in jobless claims in six weeks.Counterintuitively, investors consider higher unemployment a positive thing for risker assets – crypto and otherwise.They see a cooler employment market as an antidote for hotter inflation. Jobs data so far this year has been surprisingly positive, suggesting the U.S. economy was still expanding and that stubbornly high prices would endure.Traditional equity markets traded higher immediately following the latest job numbers, before moderating to close lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was off more than a percentage point and the S&P 500 fared nearly the same.Crypto markets saw no such bounce, however. One explanation could be that regulatory concerns are taking precedence over macroeconomic ones. On Thursday, crypto exchange Kraken agreed to “immediately” end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and to pay $30 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges it offered unregistered securities.The news followed a day after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that he'd heard rumors the SEC would like to ban retail investors from engaging in cryptocurrency staking, the income-generating technique at the core of running blockchains including Ethereum.\"I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen,\" he tweeted Wednesday.The banning of staking would remove a source of cash for certain crypto holders, removing a valued benefit in the crypto space. The threat of this occurring bit hard into digital asset prices.BTC’s chart has highlighted its decoupling from traditional assets so far this month, as its correlation with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell from as high as 0.77 to a current level of .44 and .36. Equity markets embraced the encouraging jobs data but crypto prices seemed weighted down by concerns about potential, new staking regulation.To be sure, a staking ban would apply to proof-of-stake blockchains, not a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin. But the Armstrong tweet sent nearly all crypto assets plunging.Now, it appears that crypto investors are taking more of a cautious stance than a panicked one. Trading volume remains below its 20-day moving average. The trends over the next few days will be interesting to watch.Governance tokens of the largest liquid staking protocols surged on news that U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken had settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday to sunset its crypto staking service.The LDO governance token of Lido Finance, the largest liquid staking protocol with some $8.4 billion of staked ether (ETH) on the platform, jumped 10.4% in an hour, according to data by CoinGecko. Competitor Rocket Pool’s RPL jumped 7.3%. Smaller liquid staking platform’s tokens such as Persistence’s pSTAKE and StaFi’s FIS gained 6.7 and 11.4%, respectively.Prices have more recently pared some of their earlier gains.The rally served as a counterweight to Thursday's downturn in the broader crypto market. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), that tracks the price of a basket of cryptocurrencies, decreased 2.2% in an hour. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are both in the red in the past 24 hours, with much of their declines occurring in the last three hours.Staking is the consensus mechanism to validate transactions for proof-of-stake blockchains, including Ethereum, which also offers a way for investors to earn yield on their digital asset holdings. However, the SEC has been vocal about its concerns that staking services are the equivalent of unregistered securities according to present regulations.The settlement between Kraken and the SEC might be a boon for decentralized rivals to grab market share from centralized service providers. Some of the largest centralized exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase and Kraken, let users stake cryptocurrencies and earn yield as a service on their platforms and have been popular staking providers. Staking on centralized exchanges takes up about 28% of all staked ether, data by Dune Analytics shows.Read more: Ether Liquid Staking Tokens Jump on Rumors of SEC Ban for Staking ProvidersBitcoin dipped below $22,000 Thursday and was recently down nearly 4% over the past 24 hours amid a wider market decline that largely followed news that crypto exchange giant Kraken had agreed to shut its U.S. cryptocurrency staking operations to settle charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The SEC said later Kraken will “immediately” end its crypto staking-as-a-service platform for U.S. customers and pay $30 million to settle SEC charges it offered unregistered securities.Bitcoin was recently trading at $21,900. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, followed BTC’s trend, recently trading down 4.3% to $1,569.Crypto-related stocks also struggled with Coinbase recently falling 14% during Thursday’s midday trading hours, bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) dropping 13%, MicroStrategy (MSTR), a major bitcoin acquirer, down 10%.The Kraken news followed less than a day after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted his crypto exchange company had heard “rumors” the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wanted” to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers. Armstrong’s tweet prompted a slow late Wednesday-early Thursday decline that sent BTC from its previous support just below $23,000 to about $22,500. A number of analysts have been concerned about this possible development.“It remains to be seen if these rumors are true, but what is clear is it would be a huge mistake from a U.S. perspective, as it would result in the rest of the world getting ahead in the important crypto and blockchain technology revolution,” Marcus Sotiriou, market analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an emailed comment.Several believe BTC will retreat to $20,000 support in the near future as investors also fret over stubbornly strong jobs data and an extended continuation of hawkish U.S. monetary policy that will hamstring economic growth. But others say the current lull will be temporary and segue into another price surge, similar to trends in earlier years as markets emerged from other bear markets.“What we are experiencing now seems more similar to the up and then sideways market activity that pretty much defined all of 2019,” which followed a severe price crash, Emurgo Managing Director Vineeth Bhuvanagiri wrote in a note to CoinDesk. Bhuvanagiri wrote that markets had entered “not only a recovery but an accumulation phase” that ultimately helped feed the 2020 bull run.“I think we’re more likely in a 2019 scenario than an actual bull market,” he added.Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of crypto lending platform Ledn, said in an interview with CoinDesk that while short liquidations typically fuel price increases, a recent absence of BTC short liquidations suggested there “might be more sideway trading left.”Data from crypto data platform Coinglass showed that investors had liquidated some $90 million in BTC long positions compared to around $42 million in BTC short positions over the past seven days.\"There's modest leverage being taken both to the downside and the upside,” Bartolomeo said. “Typically what creates those violent moves is leveraged. So right now I think the setup is just trading sideways for the near term.\"BTC plummeted about 60% in 2022 but regained lost ground during a triumphant January. Recent market indicators such as “movement of large amounts of BTC from centralized exchanges to self-custodial wallets,” and “the growth of daily active addresses and transactions” suggest \"a potential market bottom\" and \"a persistence of long-term investor confidence,\" according to Messari's latest quarterly report on bitcoin.\"Although the hype surrounding bitcoin has diminished, the network has historically experienced a resurgence in popularity after periods of doubt,\" Messari’s Sami Kassab and Chris Collar wrote in the report.UPDATE (Feb. 9, 2023 22:30 UTC): Adds the official SEC announcement on Kraken.CORRECTION (Feb. 10, 2023 14:23 UTC): Kraken is only closing its U.S. staking operations.The integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in financial planning and portfolio construction holds immense potential for efficiency, accuracy and security in the industry.The use of blockchain and AI in this field could revolutionize the way financial advisors build portfolios and manage client information.You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.In the field of financial planning, the integration of AI and blockchain technology could provide a much-needed upgrade. AI algorithms could analyze vast amounts of data to assist in making informed decisions regarding investments, taxes and insurance.The algorithms could make real-time adjustments to financial plans, automate updates to plans based on changing legislation and reduce the risk of errors and fraudulent activities – all in a matter of seconds. This would lead to more efficient and accurate financial plans, freeing up time for financial advisors to focus on providing personalized advice and improving client relationships.By utilizing the secure and transparent platform provided by blockchain, AI algorithms could also analyze and securely store sensitive financial information such as Social Security income information and tax information. This could allow for faster and more accurate calculations, potentially leading to financial plans that automatically adapt in real time without the need for manual updates.Read more: Here’s Why Artificial Intelligence Focused Cryptocurrencies Are Vastly Outperforming BitcoinTraditionally, portfolios have consisted of a mix of stocks, bonds, cash and sometimes a few alternative investments. However, with the advent of non-fungible tokens, the future of portfolio construction could be changing.NFTs allow for the fractional ownership and sale of any asset through smart contracts stored on a blockchain, potentially enabling portfolios to hold unique assets such as music albums, real estate, direct-held businesses, watches and artwork.These new investment opportunities would allow clients of financial advisors to not only own unique assets, but to generate income from them in various ways.All of this opens up new possibilities for investment and brings us closer to a future where the average person's portfolio may resemble that of a hedge fund or venture capital fund. By exploring these cutting-edge technologies, financial planners and investors alike may be able to create a more diverse and secure investment portfolio with an extremely wide array of assets.Watch: How AI Could Shape the Future of the NFT MarketEstate planning involves the creation and implementation of a plan for the transfer of assets after death or while alive but incapacitated. It’s often a painful and expensive process that can be hard to implement properly.With the integration of blockchain and AI in estate planning, smart contracts could be used to create, monitor and implement estate plans, potentially reducing the risk of processing problems. The use of AI algorithms in estate planning could provide real-time updates on changes in assets, the law and the market, allowing for a more accurate and up-to-date estate plan.Smart contracts on the blockchain could automate the distribution of assets and ensure they are allocated according to the wishes of the individual, without the risk of fraud or human error. Blockchain could also ensure that all estate-related information and transactions are secure, reducing the risk of data breaches.For decades, the financial advisory business has remained largely unchanged. However, these cutting-edge technologies are set to revolutionize the industry and have for years sparked a human vs. technology debate in the realm of financial advice.The incorporation of AI and blockchain technologies into the financial industry will automate many routine and complex tasks, freeing financial advisors to focus on higher-value activities that require their unique skills and expertise.Despite these advancements, the human element of financial advice will remain critical. Clients seek not only knowledgeable financial advice but also a personal touch, and financial advisors who understand the human behind the client will continue to be in high demand.Read more: Crypto AI Needs a Showcase to Know What's RealGoing forward, financial advisors will need to be proactive in their preparation to effectively incorporate AI and blockchain technologies into their practice. They will need to pay attention to not only the possible implementations of the technology but also to regulation of them and how that will affect their practice.This means financial advisors will need to stay informed and educated about the latest advancements and developments in AI and blockchain technology and make any necessary updates to their processes to stay ahead of the curve.Equally important, advisors must educate their clients on the benefits and implications of these new technologies, working together with them to develop plans that leverage their investments. By staying ahead of the curve, financial advisors and their clients can reap the benefits of these new technologies while ensuring their financial plans remain effective, efficient and secure.As the financial industry evolves and technologies evolve, the role of the human financial advisor will become no less important. The personalized touch that technology simply cannot replicate will never be replaced. Financial advisors who are able to leverage new technologies, stay up to date on the changing landscape around us – while also focusing on improving their communication skills – will be at the forefront of the industry and well-positioned for success in the years to come.Network activity on the Bitcoin blockchain has hit a level not seen since China banned crypto miners in May 2021, according to a report by CryptoQuant that cites on-chain data.This uptick in activity stems from the popularity of the Ordinals protocol, which allows for non-fungible tokens (NFT) to be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. NFT activity on Bitcoin has risen exponentially, according to research from BitMEX, with over 13,000 Ordinals minted since December.Read More: Bitcoin NFTs Explode in Popularity as BitMEX Research Shows 13,000 OrdinalsAccording to CryptoQuant’s data, the seven-day moving average of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain hit 345,000, a figure not seen since the second quarter of 2021, when miners had to pack up and leave China.Ordinals store the NFTs directly on-chain, unlike NFTs on Ethereum, which use services such as IPFS or Filecoin to store them. This has resulted in some of the largest block sizes in the history of Bitcoin, with many blocks hitting the 4 megabyte (MB) block size limit.It has also led to an increase in transaction fees, but they are still below levels seen last year.Within the Bitcoin community, the popularity of Ordinals has triggered a significant debate on whether this is the “right” use for the Bitcoin blockchain. Pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, in posts from the forum Bitcoin Talk, was strongly against non-financial uses of Bitcoin.While some of those against Ordinals cite the possibility of a rise of transaction fees as a reason to oppose them, CryptoQuant notes that an uptick in demand for block space, coupled with a rise in fees generated by miners, is positive for long-term network security for Bitcoin.The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index was recently around $22,691, down 1.1% over the past 24 hours.Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin spent another day near its most recent $23K support. LDO spikes.Insights: AI-related tokens have been surging for months amid rising institutional investment, writes CoinDesk editor  Shaurya Malwa in an excerpt from a Feb. 8 news analysis. But some observers of the space are skeptical that their current ride higher can continue.Bitcoin Holds Firm Near $23K; LDO Jumps on Armstrong TweetWhat did U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell mean in remarks Tuesday at the Economic Club of Washington D.C.?Crypto investors and otherwise spent much of Wednesday weighing a repeat of Powell's utterances from a week ago that the \"deflationary process\" had started but that the Federal Reserve would remain vigilant about stamping out high inflation; and somewhat more hawkish remarks from three Federal Reserve governors, including John Williams, who suggested central bankers would consider more aggressive rate hikes if the inflation climate worsened.Bitcoin digested the latest developments and held steady throughout the day around its current support just below $23,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $22,970, down 1.6% over the past 24 hours. BTC's recent lull follows a January surge to remember.\"Bitcoin’s strong start to the year appears to be over for now,\" Edward Moya, chief market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email. \"After hitting some key technical resistance just above the $24,000 level, bitcoin is entering consolidation modes.\"Moya added that bitcoin could lose its current perch with \"the next big move in bond yields.\"\"Bond market volatility will be insane after the Valentine’s day inflation report, which might mean bitcoin could drift towards the $20,000 level if stocks get hammered over the next few sessions,\" he wrote.Yields on two- and 10-year U.S. Treasurys both dropped slightly on Wednesday.Meanwhile, ether followed bitcoin's lead, holding its most recent support comfortably above $1,600, although it was recently down over 2% from Tuesday, same time. But as CoinDesk markets analyst Glenn Williams noted Wednesday in a column column, the second-largest crypto in market value had regained its correlation to BTC after lagging so far this year. Both cryptos are up about 38% since Jan. 1.Other major cryptos in market value were recently in the red, although Lido DAO's LDO token jumped 8% at one point, much of its gain coming late Wednesday (ET) after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that he'd heard rumors the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would like to ban retail investors from engaging in cryptocurrency staking, the income-generating technique at the core of running blockchains including Ethereum.\"I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen,\" Armstrong wrote.Equity markets closed down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component dropping 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively, as markets also continued to mull over mixed, fourth-quarter earnings and jobs data recent that has been defiantly strong, suggesting Fed monetary policy hasn't been fully successful.\"If the Valentine’s Day [Feb. 14] inflation report ends up being a hot one, traders might start believing the Fed’s hawkish pushback,\" Oanda's Moya wrote.What's With the AI Surge and Will It Last?In a Feb. 8 analysis, CoinDesk editor Shaurya Malwa highlighted the huge gains of AI-related tokens, including the platforms of Alethea's artificial liquid intelligence (ALI), Fetch.ai's (FET) and SingularityNET (AGIX), which have surged as much as 220%. Malwa wrote that institutional interest has helped create a compelling argument for crypto traders to bet on AI-focused tokens as the next growth sector. But will the momentum last? Opinions vary as Malwa notes in an excerpt from his story.AI broadly refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and act like humans. Popular applications for this technology have so far been limited to chatbots, self-driving cars, optimizing search in online marketplaces and image-generation software – but futuristic use cases envision wholly autonomous cities, cyborg humankind and interstellar travel.Much of the recent surge in AI tokens emerged after the public launch of chatbot ChatGPT and image generation software DALL-E in mid-2022. Both are traditional software that do not use cryptocurrencies or blockchain and were launched by OpenAI, which recently raised $10 billion from Microsoft at a $29 billion valuation.Such institutional interest has helped create a compelling argument for crypto traders to bet on AI-focused tokens as the next growth sector.\"The growth opportunity around the AI and Web3 space combines early interest, potential and hype,” states Ravindra Kumar, founder of crypto wallet Frontier. “While it's true that there may be some hype surrounding AI intervention in the crypto space, we are seeing the emergence of innovative and compelling use cases.’Aditya Khanduri, head of marketing at Biconomy, takes a milder approach: “I believe that the current AI trend is still pretty speculative, leading to a jump for tokens like OCEAN, ALI, AGIX. Some of the tokens with more buzz and followings have pumped and it's less about the actual tech behind it.”“This is because the current AI tokens and Web3 projects may not yet know what these decentralized AI tools look like. There's a lot of unanswered challenges and lots to be figured out,” Khanduri told CoinDesk in a recent chat.The likes of Khanduri say token-based usage while scaling AI software is a hard problem to solve.“Say an AI tool gets to 250 million users. Then what will its infra look like? How will people use it? How will the data be trained? Where does the token fit in? Can you even have a way to reward people for their data if you used it to train your models?” he said.Meanwhile, some market watchers remain cautious about the AI token hype.“Once the market starts livening up a bit, all sorts of new trends come out of the woodwork. And they are not all as solid as they might look,” financial market consultant Valentina Drofa told CoinDesk.“There is a risk that this whole ‘new trend’ is going to end up in an empty hype, as there are many speculators that would seek to make use of short-term price pumps,” Drofa added, referring to the recent multifold gains put up by some tokens.“The industry at large will end up dealing with the long-term fallout and another hit to its image. Such cycles are becoming rather tiresome and sad to observe again and again,” she stated.8:45 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:45 UTC) Bank of England Monetary Policy Report Hearings11:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:30 UTC) Reserve Bank of Australia Monetary Policy Statement12:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(16:30 UTC) China Consumer Price Index (YoY/Jan)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin, Ether Rise as Powell Talks ‘Disinflation’ Again; Crypto Donations for TurkeyCrypto prices continued their cautious move upwards after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments on disinflation yesterday.

A week ago, BTC was outpacing ETH by about 6 percentage points. The shift reflects a 1.4% rise in ETH’s price and concurrent 3.1% drop in BTC.The change also comes as the ether supply has tumbled by 17,800 year to date. Many investors view ETH as a deflationary asset that will weather upward price pressure better than other digital assets and traditional currencies.The correlation between the two assets has continued to decline as well. While the correlation coefficient between BTC and ETH is usually above .90, it now sits at .41.Correlation coefficients range between 1 and -1, with the former implying a strong pricing relationship, and the latter indicating an inverse one.The falling correlation may stem from the following intertwining factors.Investors should now watch whether the decreased correlation declines further or reverts to historic norms, although with the spread recently evaporating, the latter is likelier to occur.And investors may also want to watch the net position change for ETH. An increased amount of ether leaving centralized exchanges would signal that holders of the asset are less inclined to sell at the moment. As of Feb. 2, investors were sending more ETH to exchanges than removing it, but that has since changed.​Cross-chain bridge protocol Stargate Finance’s native STG token surged 13% over the past 24 hours following its announced plan to team up with Avalanche-based decentralized exchange Trader Joe to unlock omnichain fungible tokens.STG has recently climbed from roughly 60 cents a day ago to 92 cents. According to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, it has risen about 50% in the past seven days and 150% this year, outperforming most altcoins in the current broader digital asset rally.The partnership with Trader Joe means that Stargate will support the increasingly popular JOE token, without requiring Trader Joe to maintain a liquidity pool on the platform. On Monday, Trader Joe announced its integration with LayerZero, making JOE a multichain token to be natively sent between blockchains.STG’s climb also follows the Stargate DAO’s passage of a proposal to reissue the token and airdrop it to all STG holders. The decentralized autonomous organization's community had been raising concerns about protocol-owned liquidity (POL) and STG holder security stemming from its entanglement with Alameda Research, the trading arm of disgraced crypto exchange FTX.The Stargate DAO stated in the proposal that Alameda purchased 10% of the total STG supply from the Stargate Community sale on March 17, 2022, and then committed to lock up all these tokens until March 2025. But following FTX’s meltdown, recent on-chain transfers from known Alameda wallets revealed that \"Alameda does not have full control of its wallets and that a malicious actor or hacker is misappropriating Alameda’s funds,” the Stargate DAO said.“Without a token re-issuance, a malicious actor with access to Alameda’s private keys could claim the Stargate tokens from the contract as they vest and misappropriate them as they seem to have with other funds,” the proposal read. Stargate will reissue STG tokens on March 15.In addition, a short squeeze over the past 48 hours has pushed STG’s price higher. Data sourced from crypto futures data platform Coinglass showed that traders liquidated some $342,000 of STG short positions versus around $126,000 of STG long positions.Layer 1 blockchain NEAR Protocol’s NEAR token also rose by double-digits over the past 24 hours. NEAR was recently changing hands at $2.72, a 9% gain since Tuesday, same time. The price pump followed the protocol’s announcement that it was collaborating with New York University to start a Web 3 learning workshop. SAND, the token of metaverse game The Sandbox, was down 2%, its recent momentum fading from its announcement the Saudi Arabia Digital Government Authority would be partnering with the platform.Meanwhile, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, bitcoin and ether, were recently down roughly a percentage point to hold their most recent support. Bitcoin (BTC) was trading just below $23,000, while ether (ETH) was changing hands above $1,650. The CoinDesk Market Index which measures the overall crypto market performance was also down 1.4% for the day.Trading activity increased strongly across the board in January, but derivatives volume grew faster than spot markets, according to data from CryptoCompare.Derivatives volume in January was up 76.1% from December to $2.04 trillion, the largest percentage increase since January 2021 when volume rose 114%.Derivatives trading now represents 70.3% of the entire crypto market, up from 68% in December, according to CryptoCompare data.The large trading activity increase came alongside big gains for the world’s largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) up 40% and 32%, respectively, in January.“This suggests that price increases were driven by derivative market speculation rather than spot market accumulation,” said CryptoCompare in its report.With $1.26 trillion in volume, Binance continued as the largest derivatives exchange in January, followed by Bybit which had a 115% increase to $301 billion (the only integrated derivative exchange with triple-digit, month-on-month growth). Bybit recorded its highest-ever market share in derivative markets at 14.6% in January.Though not keeping up with derivatives, spot markets also witnessed large volume gains in January, with CryptoCompare’s AA- or A-graded exchanges posting a 67% jump in trading activity. Binance, Coinbase and Kraken were the top exchanges in terms of spot volume.Cryptocurrency data provider CoinGecko and 21.co, the parent firm of investment product provider 21Shares, are rolling out a classification system for crypto assets, the latest in a growing number of efforts to map the taxonomy of the industry and make it more accessible for participants in traditional finance (TradFi).The Global Crypto Classification Standard, announced Wednesday, categorizes digital assets according to three levels. It joins a classification system called datonomy, constructed by financial services behemoths Goldman Sachs (GS) and MSCI (MSCI) with data provider Coin Metrics, and the Digital Assets Classification Standard (DACS) from CoinDesk Indices that classifies the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization into use case and technology and then into industry and sector.The core of this trend is an attempt to impose structure on apparent chaos, and help guide conventional investors as they consider stashing money into crypto. There is a huge array of crypto assets, many of which have virtually nothing in common with each other, making the industry an intimidating one to enter.“It is crucial as there are still many misconceptions regarding crypto from traditional finance institutions,” a 21.co spokesperson told CoinDesk. “The term ‘cryptocurrency,’ widely used, is a misnomer as crypto assets can vary dramatically in nature, both as it relates to the asset (token) itself and the protocol behind it.”The Global Crypto Classification Standard, for example, categorizes assets on three levels. The first deals with networks and protocols, be they cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, monero, etc), smart contract platforms (for example, Ethereum or Solana), decentralized apps (such as Aave, Uniswap) and so on. The second groups assets by industry and sector, including centralized finance, decentralized finance (DeFi), metaverse, identity and infrastructure. The third level deals identifies the nature of the assets: a cryptocurrency, a native currency of a particular network, a stablecoin, a derivative token, or a governance or utility token, and so on.In short, the aim is to help companies and investors answer some basic questions about a network or protocol: What does it do? What type of token is associated with it? To what asset class does it belong?Having the answers helps TradFi firms know what to expect when they enter a new asset class. It allows them to create index-linked products such as exchange-traded funds (ETF), which helps to attract investors who prefer passive rather than active exposure to an asset or basket of assets.On Tuesday, for example, digital asset management platform HeightZero used CoinDesk Indices’ Large Cap Select Index, which provides a weighted performance of the largest digital assets, to offer crypto exposure to its clients in the financial advisory and wealth management spheres.Read more: Digital Asset Management Platform HeightZero Taps CoinDesk Indices to Offer Crypto Basket to Financial AdvisersThe value such products offer is illustrated by last year’s collapse of crypto exchange FTX and lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital. All of those operated as centralized platforms. In contrast, many DeFi lending protocols continued with business as normal, offering an alternative investment opportunity if only it can be identified.That’s what products such as these are looking to provide.Read more: How Digital Assets Get Into Investable IndicesCrypto markets are known to be fueled by narratives, and artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest trend.Prominent traders on Crypto Twitter are heralding AI-based tokens as the sector that might lead the next bull market cycle. They may be right so far: Such tokens are up an average of 80% in the past week alone, CryptoSlate data shows.Among the biggest gainers have been tokens for platforms such as Alethea's artificial liquid intelligence (ALI), fetch.ai (FET) and SingularityNET (AGIX), which have surged as much as 220%, as CoinDesk previously reported.The tokens of AI-based upstarts like Image Generation AI (IMGNAI) have more than tripled over a two-week period. The protocol allows users to generate artwork using text disruptions on social platforms such as Discord.One-time popular tokens from 2018 and 2021, such as Big Data Protocol (BDP) and Measurable Data (MDT), seem to have jumped on the hype with tweets that seem to remind investors of how they utilize AI technology within their blockchain applications.BDP has surged 2,100% in the past week, CoinGecko data shows, while MDT has jumped 150%. Both protocols use their tokens to commoditize data, allowing providers and buyers to exchange data securely and anonymously.Crypto majors such as bitcoin and ether have paled in comparison, rising just 30% each in the past month despite fundamental catalysts. However, the market capitalization of major tokens is upward of $300 billion, meaning they require significant amounts of investment and public interest for prices to surge multifold within a few weeks.AI broadly refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and act like humans. Popular applications for this technology have so far been limited to chatbots, self-driving cars, optimizing search in online marketplaces and image-generation software – but futuristic usecases envision wholly autonomous cities, cyborg humankind and interstellar travel.Much of the recent surge in AI tokens emerged after the public launch of chatbot ChatGPT and image generation software Dall-E in mid-2022.

Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Crypto prices continue their cautious move upwards as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell continues to hint that the war on inflation is nearing its end. Meanwhile, investors are breathing a sigh of relief after DCG and Genesis reached a deal with creditors.Insights: Alameda Research, a once-mighty force in the crypto investment world, will not be missed, say venture capital stakeholders.Bitcoin, Ether Rise as Fed Chair Talks ‘Disinflation’ Again; Market Digests DCG-Genesis-Creditors DealBitcoin is continuing its positive but cautious climb as Asia checks into the office, rising 2% on the day to $23,276 while ether is up 3% to $1,671.Traders were feeling a sense of optimism as Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated remarks from a week ago that the \"disinflationary process had started.\" Powell’s dovish comments pushed bitcoin up slightly, added 266 points to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and sent the S&P 500 up 1.3% by the time U.S. markets closed.While Powell suggested that the Fed was winning its fight to tame inflation, he was clear that the time was not yet right to declare victory, and that more rate hikes are a possibility if the job market doesn’t weaken.“The reality is if we continue to get strong labor market reports or higher inflation reports, it might be the case that we have to raise rates more,” the Associated Press quotes Powell as saying in a talk at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. “There’s been an expectation that it’ll go away quickly and painlessly. I don’t think that’s at all guaranteed.”Powell said that the Fed will need to “see whether we’ve done enough” after more rate increases.Meanwhile, crypto markets were relieved after CoinDesk reported that Genesis and its parent Digital Currency Group (DCG) have reached an initial agreement with its main creditors, meaning a long, messy court battle is unlikely. DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.Speaking on CoinDesk TV, Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of digital asset investment adviser Lumida Wealth Management, said that after this deal DCG still has a “continued headache” but “doesn’t have a noose around its neck.”“It’s going to continue to drain cash for them, but there’s a viable business on the other side of this,” he said.Why the Venture Capital Industry Won't Miss Alameda ResearchThe empire of Sam Bankman Fried was the center of the crypto universe for most of 2020-2022, and an active participant in the crypto venture capital community. What sort of impact will its demise have on the industry? Will its presence be missed, or is the VC sector better off without the embattled firm?It’s the latter, say analysts.For a while, during the bull run, it seemed like Alameda was attached to most of the hot crypto deals getting closed. Data from PitchBook shows that the former fund closed 38 deals in 2022, which is impressive considering that there are only 52 weeks in the year.But Alameda Research is no more – bankrupt, along with FTX, in an epic collapse that’s one for the history books.Certainly, the market seemed to care a lot about this as it happened. The last two months of 2022 were a crypto winter as dark as any in history, with prices in free fall with seemingly no end in sight. Come January, and things are thawing out: Bitcoin is up around 40% in the first month of the year.\"We believe there is plenty of dry powder among crypto-native and crypto-focused VC funds to more than compensate for the fundraising gap left by Alameda and FTX,” Robert Le, a senior emerging technology analyst at PitchBook, told CoinDesk in an email.Le thinks that the other major funds that PitchBook counts on its top 10 list of investors active in the crypto space will pick up the slack, such as a16z, Dragonfly and Pantera Capital.Perhaps a fair question is, does the VC world want another Alameda? Although the firm closed 38 deals it wasn’t the biggest investor. That goes to Coinbase Ventures, as PitchBook puts its deal count at 121. Despite this, Coinbase Ventures just doesn’t have the same profile Alameda had. Its management team, for example, is lesser known than Alameda’s high-profile executives.“The void left by Alameda shouldn't necessarily be completely filled by the market. It is possible their investments supported projects, which otherwise would not have had any traction, that increased the noise in an ecosystem geared towards delivering the next phase of thoughtful innovation,” Cumberland venture capital co-lead Nate George said.Peering through Alameda’s investments via CryptoRank, and one can see what George means. There are dozens of now highly illiquid, worthless tokens that had investors lining up because Alameda led the round and it had Bankman-Fried’s blessing.If there’s one sliver of good news for creditors, it’s that Alameda’s collection of portfolio companies is up around 57% in the last month, per CryptoRank data, compared to a loss of 78% during the last year.It’s not a huge deal to sell off token holdings, Mark Pfeiffer, an insolvency lawyer at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, explained to CoinDesk in an email. These ownership interests would just be another line item likely sold off during bankruptcy.The exception to that would be FTT, FTX’s native token, which at one time accounted for a material portion worth billions on Alameda’s balance sheet. It’s up nearly 120% in the last month, and has become re-listed on major exchanges like Binance, KuCoin and Gate.io (at the height of the FTX crisis it was de-listed from most exchanges). FTT, now a security in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, isn’t something that can be sold as easily.“It will be difficult, but not impossible, for the debtors to sell the tokens to monetize them,” Pfeiffer said.CoinGecko data shows that while there’s been a surge in pricing for FTT and a major uptick in volume, the spread percentage is relatively high on most exchanges, and the depth shallow. It appears to just be a fun thing to punt around on-chain and not something of material value.That’s OK, though. Alameda’s creditors have plenty of other altcoins they can sell.11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) EU leaders summit 11:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:30 UTC) National Australia Bank's Business Confidence (QoQ)6:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(22:00 UTC) Germany's Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (YoY/Jan) In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:DCG Is Selling Holdings in Several Grayscale Trusts: Financial Times; Bitcoin Holds Steady Near $23KDigital Currency Group started selling holdings in several investment vehicles run by its subsidiary and digital assets manager, Grayscale, at a steep discount, according to a Financial Times report.

The token has risen from just 40 cents on Jan. 1 to its current $2.16.The most recent uptick has followed a Render Network Jan. 31 vote to pass a new burnt-and-mint equilibrium (BME) model, capping net emissions. According to the proposal posted on GitHub, the new model would allow artists to burn the required amount of RNDR in exchange for non-fungible work credits, which are distributed to node operators.With the BME model, Render aims to make RNDR a commodity and deflationary asset. Founded by cloud rendering company OTOY's Jules Urbach in 2016, Render Network provides distributed graphics processing unit (GPU)-based rendering service for the culture and entertainment sector.Crypto data provider Coinglass showed that funding rates for the token currently remained positive in most exchanges, indicating a mostly bullish sentiment among traders.Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, edged up 2% to recently trade at $23,250. The increase followed remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who in a discussion at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., repeated his comments of last week that “a deflationary process” had started.In a Tuesday note, Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya wrote that as long as the labor market is cooling and next week’s inflation report doesn’t show a significant increase that ”bitcoin could see further bullish momentum.”Ether (ETH) emulated BTC’s pattern to recently trade at $1,670, up 3.5% from Monday, same time. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures the overall crypto market performance, was recently up 2.2%.Traditional markets also rose after Powell’s comments, with the S&P 500 index closing up 1.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished the day up 1.9% and 0.7%, respectively.Bitcoin transfers to and from crypto exchanges have fallen, signaling that markets remain cautiously optimistic about the market.A breakdown of net transfer volume by size shows that both deposits and withdrawals to and from exchanges have decreased recently, despite bitcoin's price uptick this year. The data suggests that investors are still weighing the latest, sometimes conflicting economic indicators but are also upbeat enough to hold onto their BTC instead of placing it on exchanges to trade.Net transfer volume, which was recently updated by analytics firm Glassnode, presents a visual snapshot of coins sent to or removed from centralized exchanges, categorized by size. By looking at past trends it can help market observers determine what investors are likely to do in the future.In May 2022, net transfer volumes spiked above 40,000, which ultimately preceded a 37% decline in BTC price from $30,380 to $19,000. Conversely, the decline to $19,000 accompanied a withdrawal of close to 60,000 bitcoin.The movement of coins on and off of exchanges is not a cause of price movement as much as it reflects investor sentiment. As investors begin to fear price declines, they tend to send more BTC to exchanges. The opposite occurs when investors are bullish.The recent drop implies that investors may be reluctant to make a call in either direction at the moment.Bitcoin’s has risen about 38% year to date and 44% over the last 90 days. As a result, many traders could take profits. The absence of a sharp increase in BTC deposits to exchanges should be an encouraging sign for bullish investors.In short, prices have spiked, investors seem content for the moment, and action has stalled accordingly. Volatility has also narrowed, with the Average True Range (ATR) for BTC falling 13% over the last five trading days.Trading volume for BTC has also declined, falling below its 20-day moving average for five consecutive trading days, and in eight of the last 10.Institutional traders are prioritizing bitcoin over ether exposure so far in 2023, according to a report from digital asset analysis firm Arcane Research.Open interest in bitcoin (BTC) futures listed on the derivatives giant Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has climbed 6% this year while CME’s ether (ETH) futures have declined by 29% in open interest, Arcane Research said.Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled for an asset.“This open interest trend deviates from the normal trend in CME futures, and it illustrates that BTC has led the early 2023 market strength,” Arcane Research's Bendik Schei and Vetle Lunde wrote in the report.Smaller altcoins have also rallied in January, driven by short squeezes, poor liquidity and increased risk appetite among retail investors emboldened by BTC’s surge, the report noted. In contrast, ether hasn't jumped similarly to BTC, which could explain ETH’s relatively weak start in January compared to other altcoins, according to the report.The report also highlighted that the ETH futures annualized rolling three-month basis has grown in the last few weeks and now sits at similar levels to that of BTC. Both BTC and ETH's futures basis on CME has been positive since the week of Jan. 6, signaling a positive sentiment among traders.Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk that institutional investors’ preference for BTC represented “the safest choice in a bear market.” He noted that Ethereum’s upcoming protocol updates might be raising concerns about an increased “risk of things going wrong,” and added that the Shanghai hard fork, which will allow validators who help operate the network to withdraw 16 million staked ETH, “is expected to add selling pressure.”DiPasquale also said that BTC's role could also serve as the base currency in all altcoin pairs, meaning when the market drops other cryptocurrencies would lose value in both U.S. dollar and BTC terms.\"By gaining exposure to BTC, investors can also hedge against such losses, and potentially even gain more during the initial phase of a bull run, since it is typically led by bitcoin rising in price,\" he said.While the \"disinflationary process\" has started, it will take a good deal of time before the U.S. Federal Reserve is ready to declare victory in its fight against rising price levels, said Chairman Jerome Powell, discussing the economy with Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein.Rubenstein wasted no time in the interview, leading off by asking if Friday's blowout jobs report (517,000 jobs added) might have changed the Fed's decision two days earlier to hike its benchmark federal funds rate by just 25 basis points. Powell said the news wouldn't have been likely to have made a difference.Powell's post-meeting press conference last week was notable for sending both traditional markets and bitcoin (BTC) sharply higher when he said the \"disinflationary process has started.\" He stuck with that phrase on Tuesday afternoon, but emphasized that the process is only starting and more rate hikes will be necessary.On the whole, it's hard to read Powell's comments as dovish, but markets may have been expecting a more hawkish tilt given this was the Fed chair's first chance to make public remarks following Friday's jobs report.Nevertheless, bitcoin is ahead by about $300 since the interview began, now trading at $23,300. Traditional markets are also reacting, with the Nasdaq up 1.5% and the S&P 500 by 1.1%; the 10-year Treasury yield is lower by four basis points to 3.61%.On-chain indicators are pointing toward positive sentiment for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.The bitcoin supply \"in profit,\" which is the percentage of existing coins whose price at the time they last moved was lower than the current price, has increased since the start of the year, according to data from Glassnode. The indicator has increased by over 20% since early January.“This implies that larger and longer-term investors currently hold profitable on-paper spot positions,” Bitfinex analysts wrote in a report. “This trend is healthy for the latter half of a bear market as a sustained 30-day uptrend after an extensive downtrend on this indicator has historically provided a good buy signal for the following two years,” the report added.Although bitcoin and the wider crypto market have been trading well below the all-time highs reached in November 2021, the crypto market has witnessed a positive upward trend over the past three months with bitcoin rising 50% over the last three months.On-chain data also suggests \"HODLer\" (HODLers are considered long-term holders of the cryptocurrency) conviction is high, with the Reserve Risk for bitcoin recently falling to its lowest level ever.Reserve Risk is a cyclical oscillator that models the ratio between the current price and the conviction of long-term investors, according to the Bitfinex report. The indicator trades at low levels when there is heavy investor accumulation and HODLing is the preferred market strategy.“The current price is the incentive to sell and the conviction in the ratio is a series of sub-metrics that factor in the opportunity cost of not selling. Lower the ratio, higher the conviction that investors have,” the report said.Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: What's next for crypto prices?

December’s numbers show the U.S. added 223,000 jobs to payrolls, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.5%, while recently released numbers from January show 517,000 jobs being added. Both numbers defied expectations.“I think it's still going to be very hard to get to 2%,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst with Oanda, recently said on CoinDesk TV. “The Fed acknowledged, for the first time in this cycle, they said that the disinflation process has begun.”Moya highlighted the strong labor market in the U.S. and worldwide as an obstacle to driving down inflation with increased wages supported by a fundamentally strong market.“If we see further signs that some inflation abroad is becoming stickier than we thought, then there’s a risk of a decent sell-off across Wall Street that could drag down bitcoin,” he said.Moya says he’s looking at Treasury yields. There’s still a correlation between that and the price of bitcoin that remains intact – for now.SBI's Metamask Competitor for Yen-Denominated NFT TradingJapan’s SBI, a digital assets financial services firm, recently announced it's launching a MetaMask-like wallet platform for non-fungible tokens (NFT) that’s only using the Japanese yen for trades on the SBINFT Market, CoinDesk Japan reports.Japan, with its world-renowned IP and universally recognized styles of art, is an emerging hub for NFTs. But the majority of transactions are done in U.S. dollars, not yen, which is something that SBI is looking to change.In international trade dominated by fiat, the U.S. dollar, the world’s most liquid currency and the measure for most commodities’ pricing, ranks as the highest-traded global currency, with nearly 88% of global trade denominated in greenbacks. This is predictable, as the U.S. is the world’s largest economy and most of the globe’s trade has some sort of nexus to the country.Crypto, however, is tied to no nation. There’s no centralized economy behind it. Yet, at the same time the majority of the world’s digital asset transactions are denominated in USD.“Despite the shrinking U.S. portion of the world’s GDP, the dollar increasingly dominates, notably in the digital ecosystem,” Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone wrote in an April 2021 note. “There appears to be little to stop the most consistent trends in crypto assets: rising trading volume and the proliferation of stablecoins tracking the dollar.”Case in point: Data from CoinGecko shows that there’s only around $87 million in 24-hour volume for yen-denominated bitcoin trading pairs, and roughly $21.5 million for ether trading in yen. There have been a few attempts at developing a yen stablecoin, but they don’t seem to have gotten much traction.But this comes as Japan fully embraces Web 3. As CoinDesk’s Emily Parker reported during a recent trip to the country, crypto there seems to exist in a near parallel universe. Post-Mt. Gox rules have meant that FTX Japan assets are held in third-party custody; lawmakers are working to propose a framework for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and NFTs to the Diet, the nation’s legislature.The next step of this embrace will be more crypto trading in yen.

An unexpectedly strong employment report on Friday raised fresh concerns on both counts and sent crypto assets below $23,000 over the weekend after it breached $24,000 on a couple of occasions last week.Meanwhile, ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto in market value, edged higher by 1.3% to recently trade at $1,640. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 1% for the day.Traditional markets kicked off a new week lower as investors mulled the U.S. Federal Reserve’s response to the jobs data.The S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.6% and 1%, respectively, during the afternoon trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 0.1%. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point last week after eight months of more hawkish half- and three-quarter-point hikes.“Job numbers gave credence or credibility to the fact that the Fed couldn't leave rates higher for longer and the markets have slowly started to respond to that,” Ben McMillan, chief investment officer of crypto asset manager IDX Digital Assets, told CoinDesk in an interview.BTC's current $20,000 threshold is a firm technical support, according to McMillan, although he said he wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC retest this critical mark.“Crypto volatility is gonna persist this year, even if the uptrend is structurally bullish,” he said. “I think the key thing for investors now to keep an eye on is understanding bitcoin volatility and how to price it and size it in their portfolios.”Investors are now scrutinizing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s annual sit-down with David Rubenstein at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, which could “shake things up a bit and is something the market is not pricing fully,” according to Singapore-based crypto options trading firm QCP Capital.QCP Capital wrote on Telegram Monday that equities’ performance on Monday and after Powell’s speech on Tuesday will “guide our next leg in crypto.”“If he [Powell] again defers to next week’s [consumer price index data], then we could be in for a nervous wait,” the firm added.LDO, the governance token of the Lido decentralized autonomous organization, climbed 14% to $2.28 after dropping below the $2 range earlier in the day. Data sourced from Coinglass showed that the funding rates for the token were positive, a signal that market sentiment is bullish among traders.Despite declining roughly 5.5% from Sunday, same time, layer 1 blockchain Fantom’s native FTM token has risen about 15% during the past week. A Kaiko report Monday attributed the spike to the return of Fantom's leading contributor, Andre Cronje, less than a year after he announced he was quitting.Digital Currency Group (DCG) intends to sell its subsidiary Genesis' crypto trading business as well as its lending arm, which is restructuring through bankruptcy, a Genesis attorney said Monday as the company revealed a pact with creditors.Cleary Gottlieb attorney Sean O'Neal, representing Genesis, explained the proposed settlement during the status hearing for the crypto lender, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month. Earlier Monday, CoinDesk had reported that DCG and Genesis reached an agreement with a key group of creditors. CoinDesk, like Genesis, is owned by DCG.The agreement in principle was reached with two groups of ad hoc creditors, DCG and Gemini Trust Co.Read more: Bankrupt Lender Genesis and Parent DCG Reach Initial Agreement With Main Creditors: Source\"Under the settlement, DCG would contribute that entity, [Genesis Global Trading], to [Genesis Global Holdco] ... that will happen on the effective date,\" O'Neal said. \"In the meantime, during these cases, we will actually be marketing and trying to sell not only the debtors' assets, but also GGT's because they form a nice package, and we believe that by packaging them together, we can maximize the recoveries to the estate.\"Other aspects of the proposed deal will see a restructuring of the debt that DCG owes Genesis Holdco, one of the legal entities that filed for Chapter 11 protection. Under the new terms, DCG will issue a second lien term loan facility that will mature in June 2024.\"There will be two tranches ... one will be denominated in U.S. dollars and pay 11.5% interest and tranche two will be denominated in bitcoin, [which will] pay a 5% interest,\" O'Neal said.DCG has also agreed to issue a class of convertible preferred stock, O'Neal said, though the finer details of this issuance are still being worked out.A press release published after the hearing ended said DCG would exchange its existing $1.1 billion promissory note – currently due in 2032 – for this convertible stock.Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss tweeted about the proposed settlement during the hearing, saying Gemini will itself contribute \"up to $100 million more for Earn users as part of the plan.\"Gemini partnered with Genesis to offer the Earn yield product until Nov. 16, when Genesis announced its lending business would be halting withdrawals, which then affected Gemini Earn customers' ability to access their funds.UPDATE (Feb. 6, 2023, 22:15 UTC): Adds additional details.UPDATE (Feb. 6, 22:28 UTC): Adds Gemini tweet and explains the Earn product.UPDATE (Feb. 6, 22:50 UTC): Adds Genesis press release.Asset managers are adding to historically high long positions in bitcoin, the most recent Commitment of Traders (COT) report shows.The report underscores investors’ surging confidence in crypto markets that has sent the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization up nearly 40% in January, and some altcoins by even higher.The COT report, released weekly by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), provides a breakdown of holdings and open interest for traders of futures contracts, and is a measure of market sentiment. It shows the number of long, short and spread contracts in the Dealer/Intermediary, Asset Manager/Institutional, Leveraged Funds, Other Reportables and Non Reportable Positions categories.The Asset Manager/Institutional category is comprised of larger institutional investors, i.e., pension funds, endowments, hedge funds and insurance companies.The most recent bitcoin COT report shows that of the 7,734 open futures positions for asset managers, 7,671 are long positions with just 63 being short. Asset managers added 644 long positions as of Jan. 24 – the third consecutive week that they’ve built upon an already substantial long position.As a distinct unit, asset managers with reportable futures positions are now 99.19% long, while making up 44.1% of long open interest among all reporting groups. This report is specific to asset managers with reportable futures positions to the CFTC. It does not include asset managers who have no exposure to cryptocurrencies.The 7,671 open long positions represent an all-time high in the aggregate. The 99.1% long concentration for asset managers is an all-time high as well.This trend reflects continued optimism for an asset that has already rewarded investors handsomely. Yet, a number of analysts recently have suggested the crypto market is due for a retreat amid conflicting macroeconomic signals, most notably the stubbornly resilient job market.The COT findings could also suggest that asset managers have reached an extreme that is likely to reverse. Upcoming COT reports will indicate whether asset managers continue to go all-in on BTC, or whether they’ve decided to reduce exposure by going short.How long the labor market’s better-than-expected recovery lasts could have an impact on how quickly inflation falls, Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” Monday.“These disinflation trends are gonna hit a brick wall pretty soon,” Moya said. “That’s because the labor markets [are] too hot, and that’s really confusing traders.”Ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Tuesday, Moya said the U.S. economy is “nowhere near getting the job done with inflation.” He noted the current annual inflation rate of 6.5% is far above above the Fed's 2% target. Powell may need to take a more hawkish approach in future, he said.“It's still going to be very hard to get to 2% [inflation],” Moya said, adding the inflation situation has placed traders in a tough spot.“There are a lot of traders that were thinking that they might be done,” Moya said, referring to expectations of what the Fed would do about rate hikes after last week's jobs report. “Now all of a sudden you're looking at the market and now it's leaning towards maybe two more 25 basis point [interest] rate increases.”“These expectations are widely swinging,” Moya said. He said traders aren’t necessarily being influenced by layoffs in the tech and finance sectors but by the labor market’s projected growth.Until that weakens, he said, “you’re going to continue to see continued wage pressure, which is going to make the Fed stare at [the] labor market and inflation report and say, ‘Well, maybe we need to continue with this hawkish pushback,’” Moya said.He said investors should price in at least one to two more interest rate hikes.“We're probably rangebound for a little bit until we have much clearer clarity, which won't happen for probably a few months,” Moya said, referring to the crypto and equities markets.Read more: First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Not Ready to Soar as Investors Await Fed Chair Speech, More EarningsClearpool, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, will launch its noncustodial institutional borrowing platform Clearpool Prime in the first quarter of this year, according to a Monday blog post outlining plans for 2023.Institutional borrowers, after going through know-your-customer checks, will be able to create so-called permissioned borrowing pools on Clearpool Prime with their own set of loan terms such as size, duration and interest rate. They’ll also be able to invite lenders to the pool.Clearpool is a blockchain-based credit marketplace that connects borrowers to lenders with hosting borrowing pools. Lenders, when they provide liquidity to a pool, receive so-called cpTokens that are specific to the pool in return. Those who hold the protocol’s governance token, CPOOL, can participate in voting and stake their tokens to earn rewards. So far, some $350 million of stablecoin loans have originated on Clearpool on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, per data on Clearpool’s loan dashboard.Clearpool’s new platform comes as DeFi protocols aim to attract established institutional investors with more sophisticated products to ramp up lending after a disastrous past year. As the crypto market crashed and multiple crypto trading firms who were large borrowers blew up, centralized lenders such as CoinDesk sister company Genesis and Celsius Network encountered liquidity problems and several decentralized lending protocols left with defaults and bad debt.Read more: Maple Finance Plots Comeback With New $100M Liquidity Pool for Tax Receivables With 10% Yield“Prime addresses many of the problems that led to systemic risk in the CeFi [centralized finance] lending market in 2022, and we are confident that it will be a valuable addition to Clearpool and the institutional DeFi ecosystem,” the post said.Clearpool also announced plans to expand the assets supported for borrowing in its permissionless borrowing pools to all ERC-20 and wrapped ERC-20 tokens such as wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and wrapped ether (wETH). The first such pool will open in the coming months, according to the post.The protocol will add permissionless term pools, where borrowers will be able to take out loans with fixed maturity periods. Lenders can lock up their cpTokens to earn additional yield. Clearpool will also issue designated tokens for the term pools called tpTokens that holders can trade on secondary markets.The protocol unveiled a product called Exchange Traded Pools (ETP), “a first in DeFi,” per the blog post. These will allow lenders “to diversify liquidity across multiple borrower pools in a single transaction, mitigating counterparty risk while maintaining yield opportunities.\"CPOOL has gained 8% in the past 24 hours, outperforming BTC (-0.15%) and the CoinDesk Market Index (+0.16%).This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.

Bitcoin began to fall on Thursday after posting an upward trajectory in January, when it gained 40%, according to data from TradingView. Monday’s drop comes as Wall Street equity futures and European stocks dipped following Friday’s unexpectedly strong jobs report from the U.S. The rest of the crypto market was also trading in the red on Monday.South Korea's Financial Services Commission on Monday published guidelines on which security tokens will qualify for regulation under the country's capital markets rules.

Now, the bankrupt crypto exchange wants that money back. On Sunday, FTX Group said it is sending “confidential letters” to politicians and other political beneficiaries of Bankman-Fried, his deputies and his companies, asking them to return the money by the end of the month. In a press release the firm said it reserved the right to try and force repayments – plus interest – through court action.Ethereum has witnessed much healthier on-chain activity recently, with improved interest in non-fungible-tokens (NFT) led by the launch of a mini-game by Yuga Labs, Bernstein said in a research report Monday.Daily fees on the blockchain have more than doubled since the start of the year from around $2 million to $4 million-$6 million, the report said. Ether (ETH) has gained around 35% in value.Bernstein notes that ether inflation has remained negative for over two weeks, with the expectation of further deflation with more on-chain activity and demand.“We do believe BTC [bitcoin] and ETH remain relatively clean here and will see gradual conviction-based spot positioning,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.The next big catalyst for Ethereum remains the Shanghai upgrade due in mid-March, when withdrawals of staked ether will be enabled, the note said.There may be some caution heading into this event because of concerns around supply from the unstaked ether as 70% of the ETH staked has been through liquid staking pools such as LIDO or led by exchanges, the report said.The remaining ether has been directly staked into the Beacon Chain and is unlikely to be short-term holders. Therefore, there may be caution approaching the event, “but improved conviction in holding in spot markets, as the fears recede,” the report added.Read more: Deflationary Ether Is Underperforming Bitcoin, Here Are 3 Reasons WhyGood morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin dipped below $23K earlier in the weekend and flattened on Sunday as investors await the next utterances from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.Insights: If crypto continues to rebound, venture capital in blockchain projects is likely to rise. Will venture capitalists avoid their past investment mistakes in the blockchain space?Crypto Trades Flat as Investors Await Powell Speech, More EarningsBy Sam ReynoldsMajor digital asset prices traded flat over the weekend, with bitcoin down 1.7% and ether in the red 2.3% over the weekend.After a mediocre start to earnings season, investors are thought to be looking ahead to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech before the Economic Club in Washington, D.C., scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, before making any big moves.FactSet data shows that less than 1% of the companies in the S&P 500 reported earnings that were above estimates. This is below the five-year average of 8.6%, and the 10-year average of 6.4%.\"As a result, the earnings decline for the fourth quarter is larger today compared to the end of last week and compared to the end of the quarter,\" FactSet's senior earnings analyst John Butters wrote in a Friday market update. \"If the index reports an actual decline in earnings for Q4 2022, it will mark the first year-over-year decline in earnings reported by the index since Q3 2020.”Speaking late last week on CoinDesk TV, David Siemer, CEO of SEC-registered, digital asset investment manager Wave Financial, said that the market is giving mixed signals – strong job numbers, but mediocre earnings results – and he still expects a recession this year, albeit a weak one.“I am a little more optimistic that it won't be quite as severe a recession as in a great recession or major, major recession,” he said, pointing to the resilience of consumers. “The fact that the Fed's actions are having such a slow effect doesn't mean cumulatively they won't eventually have a major effect. We're probably still a quarter or two away from seeing what the Fed's actions have really actually done to the economy.”And what does this mean to crypto prices, looking forward? Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BiBull Capital, wrote in a note to CoinDesk that crypto markets are “optimistic” after a modest rate increase and bitcoin will “oscillate around the $20K support level for the next few months, barring other unforeseen events and market action.”Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is opening the Asia trading week at 103.12, staying in what many analysts call a “defensive” position. The measure of the world’s largest fiat asset spent most of last year surging, hitting stock and crypto prices hard. Year-to-date it’s down 1.4%.Can Crypto VCs Avoid the Mistakes of Last Year?By Sam ReynoldsThe last quarter of 2021 was the end of an unprecedented bull market that began the year before with COVID-included macroeconomic policy and finished with the Fed raising rates in 2022, and with a trio of collapses, most notably crypto exchange FTX and its trading arm Alameda Research. Venture capitalists enjoyed the ride on the way up, but certainly felt the pain on the way down in 2022 as cascading failures knocked the wind out of their portfolios.For the industry, the trillion-dollar question will be: Did VCs learn anything, and can they avoid repeating the mistakes of last year that severely dented their profits. VCs invested furiously as crypto prices rose but their methods often seemed slapdash.An upbeat JanuaryBitcoin and many altcoin categories had a fantastic January, with the world’s largest digital asset rising 40% on-month, some metaverse tokens making triple-digit gains and layer 1s such as Aptos’ APT rising by over 300%. Some of the more bullish takes even predict bitcoin hitting $45,000 by Christmas.But despite these data points indicating that crypto winter is thawing, VCs' investment in digital asset and blockchain projects fell 90% in January, according to a recent CoinDesk report.\"Over the past 18 months, VC investments into crypto reached a peak, with investments spread across the entire ecosystem. Diligence cycles were compressed to weeks and sometimes days during this time, with many investors shunned out of the round if they asked crypto startups follow-up diligence questions (this is partly why FTX was not properly diligenced),” Robert Le, a senior emerging technology analyst at Pitchbook, told CoinDesk in an email.Le said that during the past six months, there has been a significant slowdown in the speed at which VCs do deals, with the diligence cycle now taking months.“Capital is now concentrated into areas with business models and product market fit. There is also less appetite for pure token rounds, with many investors preferring equity,\" Le said.Throughout the 2020-22 bull market cycle, many observers found it almost comical how many projects of questionable merit, teams with negligible skills, and projects without a proper fit received a seemingly, never-ending bucket of funding.The stats are sobering: CertiK says there was more than $3.7 billion in tokens stolen, scammed, or attacked in 2022; in 2021 there were over $2.8 billion in rug pulls, a term for teams absconding with investors’ tokens.“Investors were very willing to underwrite risk, bet on exploratory and niche products, and take an optimistic view of the space,” Nate George, venture capital co-lead at Cumberland, told CoinDesk.George said that investors tolerated poorly constructed legal documents with extremely limited investor protections, just to get into the sector. In turn, throughout the 2021-22 cycle, funds employed a “scattershot approach” to investing with large collections of investors writing small checks demonstrating their low conviction to the project.Effectively everyone who wanted it got funding.“Startups were able to raise uncharacteristically sized rounds for their stage, commonly acquiring multiple years of runway pre-product, while over the course of the last six months, investors pivoted to underwriting fewer deals targeting higher conviction, more concentrated bets,” George told CoinDesk in a note. “During this period of time, investors began to re-evaluate their focus on what constitutes product market fit, realizing that large token incentive programs rewarding user participation creates distorted traction metrics and overlooks user stickiness.”Moving into springA lot must be going through investors’ minds at the moment. On one hand, there’s lots of data – in the form of bloody red losses on profit-and-loss statements – to show that a slower, high-conviction approach to investing is better for both the industry and the fund’s return.But at the same time, this is the season of altcoins. SHIB is up nearly 50% this past month. Metaverse tokens, despite the questionable traction platforms like Decentraland have, are doing very well.Data from CryptoRank shows that smaller, more nimble funds are making the triple-digit returns.And what are they investing in? Lesser-known protocols. The stuff that climbs fast and falls hard. Stuff that would be part of a “scattershot” portfolio.That’s not to say that the largest funds aren’t doing well in the last month.Coinbase Ventures, which was very busy throughout 2022 with 121 closed deals, according to Pitchbook, has seen its token portfolio rise by 56% over the past month. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is around the same. Animoca Brands, which was rumored to be suffering from serious financial strife at the end of last year, has had its fortunes turn around in a big way.But which thesis will win?9:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:00 UTC) Eurozone Retail Sales (YoY/Jan)10:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(14:30 UTC) Japan Overall Household Spending (YoY/Dec)2:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(18:30 UTC) Reserve Bank of Australia Interest Rate DecisionIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Hovers Around $23K as US Adds 517K Jobs in January; Sam Bankman-Fried Is Negotiating Bail ConditionsThe first U.S. jobs report of the year revealed that nonfarm payrolls grew by 517,000 in January, while the unemployment rate was little-changed at 3.4%.

Bitcoin and ether finished another positive week, even as the stubbornly strong jobs market raised questions about the U.S. Federal Reserve’s next interest rate move.The U.S. added a whopping 517,000 jobs in January, 98% higher than the prior month, and 172% higher than expectations. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, while the labor force participation rate rose to 3.4%.Investors may view the robust job market negatively as it suggests the economy is not cooling as much as other economic data indicates, and may prompt the U.S. central bank to extend its current series of rate increases. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said taming inflation, which topped 9% at one point in 2022, remains a priority.Central bankers must weigh the United States’ own interest obligations, along with recessionary concerns, as they mull additional changes to monetary policy that would staunch rising prices. The United States interest payments have increased 41% since the first quarter of 2022.The options traditionally available to governments to manage debt obligations include raising taxes, reducing spending or increasing borrowing. The combination of these factors can send markets downward.Traditional markets have been mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) trading higher while the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite declined today.Fixed income markets appear cautious because the yield on the two-year Treasury note also rose on the day.Derivatives markets appear to be pricing in higher interest rates for the first two quarters of 2023.Crypto markets at least momentarily appear to be shrugging off the unsettling jobs numbers because many of the top names by market capitalization posted solid weekly gains.Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) finished near the middle of the pack, rising 2% and 4%, respectively, over the last seven days. ATOM and litecoin (LTC) led the way, up 12.3% and 11.5%, respectively, while XMR and APT lagged the pack, down 3.9% and 4.3%.Bitcoin (BTC) is currently priced significantly lower than it was in late 2021. Still, the mood in the market is as positive as it was back then.That's the message from funding rates, a mechanism that keeps the prices of bitcoin perpetual futures contracts in sync with the spot market price. When perpetual futures are trading above spot, the funding rate is positive and holders of bullish long, or buy, positions pay bearish shorts to keep their trade open. The opposite happens when perpetuals trade below the spot price.Analysts track the funding rate to gauge the mood of leverage traders. The higher the funding rate, the more excited traders are about price prospects and the more willing to pay a premium to keep their upside bets open.As of Thursday, the annualized bitcoin perpetual funding rates across major exchanges including Binance was 8.491%, the highest since Dec. 3, 2021, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.Back then, one bitcoin was priced around $57,000, or 2.5 times the current market rate of $23,400. The cryptocurrency set a record high of $69,000 in November 2021.The funding rate flipped positive in mid-December last year, indicating seller exhaustion. The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at the turn of the year and has rallied over 40% since then.\"There has been a clear shift in market sentiment post-[December) CPI with funding rates well into positive territory and price volatility on the rise,\" Dessislava Laneva, a research analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, said in a tweet referring to the U.S. consumer price index.The CPI fell to 6.5% in December, the sixth straight monthly deceleration in price increases. The data convinced markets that the Federal Reserve was likely to pivot to liquidity-boosting interest rate cuts later this year.Early this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the inflation picture and downplayed concerns of a severe tightening-induced economic slowdown, bolstering the pivot hopes.The U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC is likely to show the world's biggest economy added 185,000 jobs in January following December's 223,000 increase, according to Reuters estimates sourced from FXStreet.The unemployment rate is forecast to tick slightly higher to 3.6% in January, while average hourly earnings, or wage growth, is expected to print at 4.9% year on year following December's 4.6% rise.A notable increase in average hourly earnings, a proxy for potential inflation, coupled with the headline jobs figure might see investors reconsider the possibility of the Fed keeping interest rates higher for longer and scale back bullish positioning in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.Good morning.

The largest cryptocurrency by market value has risen about 40% this year amid investors' growing optimism about inflation and the economy. The Federal Reserve's 25 basis point (bps) increase bolstered markets' sense that bankers were succeeding in their quest to staunch stubbornly high prices.In an interview with CoinDesk TV's \"First Mover\" program, Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian investment manager 3iQ, said that despite its recent gains bitcoin was still trading below its 200-day moving average.\"We believe that as we get nearer [to the 200-day average] – which is a huge fundamental catalysts for bitcoin, and we have no reason to believe it won't be again – that [bitcoin] will see an even further move higher,\" Connors said.Connors comments dovetailed with a CoinDesk report that bitcoin and the S&P 500 were approaching an easy-to-track bullish technical signal – a golden cross. A golden cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the security's price moves above its 200-day SMA, producing a cross on the price chartEther fared similarly on the day, dipping late to also fall 1.8% from Wednesday, same time. The second-largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands near $1,650. Other major cryptos declined late in the day to flatten or also drop into negative territory. APT, the token of layer 1 blockchain Aptos, plunged 6.5% to lose some of the ground it has gained this year. APT rose more than any other token in January. GALA, the token of the Gala Games play-to-earn platform declined 5%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the crypto market's performance, was recently down 1.8%.Equity markets enjoyed a banner day with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 rising 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively as investors' hopes about inflation outweighed their concerns about disappointing fourth-quarter results on Thursday from Apple and Alphabet and a wider slowdown in the once fearsome technology sector. \"Financial markets believe inflation will decline more quickly than the Fed is currently thinking,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email.3iQ's Connors noted increasing interest recently in 3iQ's crypto exchange traded funds, part of larger wave when investors poured more than $200 million into these types of products in January, according to crypto data provider group Crypto Compare.\"We had more smiles,\" Connors quipped. \"We had to bring in some new coins to satisfy inflows. That was good. And it wasn't kind of crazy numbers. It was it was a nice healthy number.\"Connors added that current growth is sustainable. \"I think the [price] entry point is so good. If people are buying, they're the type of people who really want in. So there's not FOMO going on right now even though we're up. I really like this layer of buyer coming in here because they've done the work, they've shaken off the FTX debacle as a bad actor, a fraud.\"Crypto Trading Volume Increases Following Fed DecisionBy Glenn WilliamsBitcoin and ether saw trading volumes increase following the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) rate decision.About $32 billion in bitcoin changed hands on Thursday, a 20% increase over the previous day, and 40% higher than the $23 billion worth of BTC that traded the day prior to the Fed decision.Ether’s volume was 30% higher than on Wednesday, and 60% higher than volume preceding the FOMC announcement.Data from exchanges across all spot markets reflects continued interest in the assets as the formerly challenging macroeconomic picture settles and investor optimism rises.8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 a.m. UTC): Japan bank services purchasing managers index (Feb.)9:45 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:45 a.m. UTC): Caixin services purchasing managers index (Jan.)21:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 p.m. UTC): U.S. unemployment rate (Jan.)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Briefly Tops $24K; Decentralized Social Network Nostr's Damus Gets Listed on Apple App StoreBitcoin was trading above $23,500 after breaking through $24,000 in the early hours.

Layer 1 blockchain Avalanche’s AVAX token surged almost 3.4% to recently trade above $22. Altcoins’ gains have been part of an overall market upswing that followed the Fed’s announcement underscoring its commitment to less aggressive monetary tightening.Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value, was recently trading over $1,650, up a fraction of a percentage point since Wednesday, same time.Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading above $23,560, roughly flat over the past 24 hours, albeit slightly in the red. BTC had been changing hands in a narrow range between $23,700 and $24,200 since the Fed announcement before dipping late Thursday.The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures crypto market performance, was recently flat after spending much of the day in the green.Crypto markets’ performance correlated with traditional markets' post-rate announcement rally. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 closed up 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively, a day after Powell said \"[the] disinflationary process” had “started.\"Crypto-exposed stocks also soared: Exchange Coinbase (COIN) surged 24%, while MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software company with a large bitcoin portfolio, rose 9%. Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) was up 6.3%.Digital assets’ positivity suggested that \"the bottom of this [down] cycle is probably in for crypto, and that we are entering something of a recovery phase for this market,” Joe Ziolkowski, CEO and co-founder of crypto-focused insurer Relm Insurance, told CoinDesk.“Both retail and institutional-grade investors are allocating more and more capital to crypto assets,” Ziolkowski said. “This trend will likely continue if it becomes clearer that the blowups that took down FTX, [Terra] and Three Arrows [Capital] are over with.”Ben McMillan, chief investment officer of crypto asset manager IDX Digital Assets, said bitcoin and the broader crypto market were \"early in this bid for risk-on assets.\"\"I wouldn't be surprised if we see a pause here for crypto while equity markets 'catch up,'\" McMillan added in an email.Bitcoin and ether have been taking different paths so far in 2023, which could present a buying opportunity for crypto investors.The two largest cryptocurrencies’ net position change on exchanges has veered away from one another after correlating closely throughout 2022. An asset’s net position on exchanges is the difference between deposits and withdrawals.BTC’s net position on exchanges reflects declining supply, while the increase in ETH’s net position indicates a larger stockpile on exchanges.An asset’s exchange net position is noteworthy because increases in value often precede the asset being sold, while decreases indicate that investors are removing the asset from exchanges to place it in cold storage. Investors may be able to anticipate the resulting price changes.The shift in net position for bitcoin and ether occurred at approximately the same time (Jan 19). Investors may be treating BTC and ETH as substitutes for each other, or possibly indicating they prefer bitcoin to ether.The ETH/BTC currency pair is down 3% year to date, after being off as much as 8%. Ether has underperformed bitcoin, despite its supply contracting by 6,700 ETH since September. With no change in ETH’s overall utility and its traditionally high correlation to BTC, investors may find it odd that the asset has fallen relative to bitcoin.ETH’s correlation coefficient relative to BTC has fallen 18% since Jan. 23, without a clear explanation why. A return to correlation norms in conjunction with a continued rise of BTC prices would imply an accelerated move higher for ETH.Future flows of ether onto and/or off exchanges may show whether investors believe that the difference in performance represents an opportunity. Ether's price is still up 39% year to date, but trails BTC’s 43% move higher. Should investors begin to remove ETH from exchanges, the trend could signal the asset’s move higher.Ether also appeared on a Thursday morning screen of approximately 90 cryptocurrencies that identify assets whose price has surpassed the upper bound of its Bollinger Bands.The Bollinger Bands indicator measures an asset’s 20-day moving average, while plotting “bands” that sit two standard deviations above and below the average. An asset breaching the upper band indicates increased volatility along with a price move outside normal expectations.The move higher comes in conjunction with higher-than-average volume, which bolsters the idea that investors may be perceiving a disconnect in value and looking to take advantage of it.Ethereum layer 2 scaling system Optimism on Wednesday proposed a mainnet upgrade to boost performance and functionality, accelerating the rally in its governance token OP.\"The Optimism Foundation is proud to propose the first protocol upgrade to the Optimism Collective: Bedrock,\" the proposal floated in the governance forum said.\"This upgrade offers a new level of modularity, simplicity, and Ethereum equivalence for layer 2 solutions, providing unprecedented performance and functionality,\" the proposal added, noting additional benefits that may lead to a Cambrian explosion of layer 2 protocols.OP has rallied nearly 25% in the past 24 hours, hitting a new record high of $2.90, CoinDesk data show. The Bedrock proposal seems to have driven the token higher.The community will vote on the proposal after two weeks of discussion. If approved, the upgrade will be implemented on March 15 at 9:00 a.m. PT (17:00 UTC).Bedrock is a rollup architecture developed by Optimism. Rollups enable batching and publishing hundreds of transactions in a single mainnet block. In other words, they compress many transactions into one, speeding up the blockchain.Per Messari's Kunal Goel, the Bedrock upgrade will help Optimism improve transaction fees and speed and create a foundation for future improvements like decentralized sequencing, helping it compete with its main rival, Arbitrum. \"OP Labs expects Bedrock will make optimism the cheapest rollup on Ethereum,\" Goel said in a research note last month.Web3 research and development firm Xord's research writer Zainab Hasan expects the Bedrock upgrade to reduce the block time of Optimism in case of pending transactions from 13 seconds to 2 seconds and facilitate faster deposits.\"With Bedrock, Optimism will be the first EVM-based rollup to deliver Ethereum-level security guarantees,\" Hasan said in an analysis published in October.Optimism's OP token has rallied nearly 200% in the past few weeks, outshining bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) by a big margin. The top two coins have gained 44% and 39%, respectively. Optimism's rival Arbitrum doesn't have its native token yet.Optimism has also outpaced in terms of the percentage growth in total value locked in the decentralized finance ecosystem in the past 30 days.Data from DeFiLlama shows the total value locked (TVL) in Optimism has increased by 47% to $744 million, while that in Arbitrum has gone up by 27% to $1.3 billion.\"One of the big narratives of 2023 looks to be Layer 2's and the only way to get direct exposure to them right now is through the OP token,\" Conor Ryder, research analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, said. \"TVL on Optimism has also outpaced Arbitrum, its closest competitor, to start the year.\"The layer 2 adoption kicked off last year with Arbitrum and Optimism experiencing a steady growth in the user base despite the broader market swoon. Active user participation on Optimism surpassed that on Arbitrum at the end of December.If that's not enough, early today, Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes, announced the integration of its dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD and its wrapped version Binance-peg BUSD on Optimism.Binance users can now move BUSD and Binance-peg BUSD across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, TRON, Avalanche and Optimism networks.The integration may galvanize more investor interest in Optimism, considering BUSD is the world's third-largest stablecoin by market value. At press time, BUSD has a market cap of over $16 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $12.14 billion.\"BUSD is one of the largest stablecoins, and having it on Binance simplifies the user experience for retail and institutional traders without the need for decentralized bridges,\" said pseudonymous DeFi researcher Ignas, speaking to CoinDesk.\"Currently, only Ethereum, Polygon, Avax, and Tron are supported. Surprisingly, Arbitrum is not yet supported,\" Ignas added.Edit: 13:36 UTC, Feb. 3: Corrects Messari analyst's name to Kunal Goel. The previous version said Kunal Shah.Bitcoin (BTC) and Wall Street's benchmark equity index, the S&P 500, are on the verge of hitting an easy-to-track bullish technical signal – the golden cross – that often makes traders giddy with delight.A golden cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the security's price moves above its 200-day SMA, producing a cross on the price chart. Because moving averages are backward-looking indicators, the signal tells us only that the market's short-term gains have surpassed its long-term gains. Still, chart analysts and traders see it as a harbinger of higher prices over the long run.\"The winds of change have started to blow with the increasing likelihood of bullish golden crosses in the near future,\" analysts at Valkyrie recently noted in a newsletter, referring to the impending crossover on the daily bitcoin and S&P 500 charts.Bitcoin will likely see its first golden cross since September 2021 in the next week or two, according to charting platform TradingView. Meanwhile, the S&P 500's averages appear on track to produce the golden cross on Thursday.The concurrent appearance of the golden cross on bitcoin and the S&P 500 might motivate trend-following crypto traders to hit the market with fresh bids. Bitcoin has evolved as a macro asset since early 2020 and tends to move more or less in line with the S&P 500.Traders, however, should note that while bitcoin's big rallies often start with a golden cross, not all golden crosses lead to a big rally.Bitcoin has seen eight golden crosses to date, of which three, confirmed in February 2012, October 2015 and May 2020, were on point, presaging at least a yearlong bull market that saw prices rally between 100% and 350%, data from TradingView shows.On the other hand, golden crosses of July 2014, July 2015 and February 2020 were bull traps as the cryptocurrency crashed violently into a death cross in the following weeks/months. The death cross is the opposite of the golden cross and represents a bearish shift in the long-term trend.The remaining two golden crossovers, formed in April and September 2019, were undecisive, with prices rising sharply in the following two months only to slip into a death cross later.The S&P 500's past data paint a similar picture. The index has seen 52 golden crosses since 1930. In that time, stocks rose in the following year 71% of the time, according to a MarketWatch report quoting Dow Jones Market data.So, the golden cross appears unreliable as a standalone bullish indicator and should be read in conjunction with other factors, mainly the Federal Reserve's policy, which is becoming less hawkish with each passing month.As expected, the central bank stepped down to a smaller 25 basis point rate hike on Wednesday, lifting the benchmark borrowing cost to the new range of 4.5% to 4.75%. During the post-meeting press conference, Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledges that \"inflation has eased somewhat\" while downplaying the risk of tightening-induced economic recession, bringing cheer to risk assets.According to ING analysts, the Fed is likely to deliver another 25 basis-point increase in March and then pause the rate-hike cycle that rocked financial markets last year.Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Crypto investors may have been expecting a 25 basis point rate hike, but the Fed's announcement didn't stop them from sending bitcoin and other cryptos higher. Will crypto assets move higher as more economic data pours in?Insights: Waves' USDN token is exiting its stablecoin model in an XTN rebrand. What is the significance?Bitcoin Embraces the Fed's Latest Rate HikeBy James RubinThe Federal Reserve decreed a 25 basis point interest rate hike the world would see.Bitcoin was moved, and then pushed past its former $23,000 threshold groove.At least for a few hours following the central bank's much anticipated dovish tilt, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was feeling poetic, recently trading at $23,967, a roughly 3.7% gain over the past 24 hours. BTC soared past $24,100 at one point Wednesday after lingering below $23,000 for much of the past week.Investors seemed more interested in Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments Wednesday that the U.S. central bank's inflation fight was far from over than his remark that \"[the] disinflationary process has started.\" The Fed is still looking to slash inflation to 2% from its most recent 6.5% level in December.How long bitcoin continues to trade in its current range near or above $23,000 remains unclear with some market observers believing that prices will retreat, but others highlighting more optimistic signs, including the Fed's last two more moderate rate hikes. \"Historically, as interest rates rise moderately, as opposed to aggressively the average returns and bitcoin increase massively, more so than traditional assets since the speculators return quickly to buy as the credit and money become more available,\" CoinDesk Indices Managing Editor Jodie Gunzberg told CoinDesk TV's \"First Mover\" program.Gunzberg noted \"evidence of the number of bitcoin on wallets of [over-the-counter trading] desks rising in January, a signal that \"institutional investors such as hedge funds that typically use these desks for large transactions\" were buying bitcoin, pushing up its price.\"Ether fared even better on Wednesday, jumping close to $1,680, a 5.7% rise since Tuesday, same time. Other cryptos spent much of their day in the green with layer 2 network Optimism's OPT token, a big winner a week ago, climbing almost 25%, and layer 1 blockchain Aptos Network's APT token rising more than 9% to continue its momentum from January. APT surged 387% last month.Equity markets also embraced the Fed announcement, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, rising 2% and 1%, respectively. Less than three months ago, with inflation lingering above 7%, a heftier increase seemed more likely. \"Markets have been proved right today as the Federal Reserve announced a lower-than-previously-indicated rate hike of 25 bps,\" Oliver Rust, head of product at independent inflation at economic data-aggregator Truflation, wrote in an email.Still, investors will be eyeing new data over the next two days, including jobless claims, and fourth quarter earnings from tech giants Amazon and Google, which in recent weeks have both announced mass layoffs tied to recessionary concerns. On Wednesday, social media platform Meta Platforms (META) reported that it had continued to lose massive amounts of money in its fledgling Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations. FRL accounted for a loss of $4.3 billion in the quarter, better than the consensus of analyst estimates for a loss of $4.4 billion and up from a loss of $3.7 billion in the third quarter.In its January markets report, CoinDesk Indices noted that bitcoin's nearly 40% monthly increase was its largest since October 2021 near the end of the last bull market and 12th best month in its history, and that other digital assets had fared even better. \"Crypto made a comeback in January as the macroeconomic environment turned brighter with decelerating inflation and expectations the Fed will dial back the pace of interest rates,\" the report said. It added that a falling dollar was further buoying the market and that \"as inflation and interest rates moderate, it also propels bitcoin more than traditional assets historically.\"Gunzberg highlighted cryptos' rising volatility relative to \"traditional asset classes,\" a sign of optimism. \"The change in sentiment on the macroeconomic backdrop is driving crypto buying especially from the speculators,\" she said. \"It's the first stop where investors play as the credit and the money become more available.\"Waves’ USDN Token Abandons the Stablecoin Model in XTN RebrandBy Shaurya MalwaStablecoins formed a distinct sector in the past bull market cycle, with centralized tokens including USD coin (USDC) and tether (USDT) reaching billions of dollars in market capitalization even as their decentralized counterparts mostly failed to maintain the $1 peg.Terra’s UST was perhaps the poster boy of failed stablecoins. The algorithmic token, which relied on a basket of assets that supposedly backed its $1 value, fell over 90% to a few cents as the Terra ecosystem imploded last May. The price of Terra’s luna token suffered even more, falling 99% within days to nearly zero.Those declines stemmed from how algorithmic stablecoins like UST operated. One UST could be redeemed or minted for exactly $1 worth of LUNA at any time. In theory that helped UST retain its value and created demand for both tokens.Traders could continuously buy and sell LUNA and UST to maintain the peg and profit by doing so, incentivizing them to maintain UST’s peg.Terra’s horrors have dissuaded decentralized finance (DeFi) developers from launching algorithmic stablecoin projects. Some, like the recently launched Djed on Cardano, have shifted and positioned themselves as an overcollateralized token – with $1 worth of djed backed by $4 to $8 worth of Cardano-based tokens.A rebrandSome of the few surviving DeFi stablecoins are changing their models and rebranding entirely.Neutrino, which issued the USDN stablecoin on Waves blockchain, floated a community vote last year to move away from an intended $1 peg altogether. The vote was passed earlier this week.“Before the 2022 bear market, USDN was a reliable option for those looking to store value,” Neutrino developers said in a recent post. “With the current setup, clearly, USDN can not withstand the unprecedented market volatility. However, the team and community believe USDN can still perform a valuable use case in the Waves ecosystem by pivoting to a different model.”USDN was among the several stablecoins that depegged last year. – it lost 9 cents in August, a slip that Waves founder Sasha Ivanov defended at the time.The pivot to XTN will see the coin being collateralized by a basket of tokens from the Waves ecosystem, with its value floating based on supply and demand and the Backing Ratio (BR).The BR represents the total value of all assets held in collateral against the circulating supply and will target a 100% ratio, making the price tend towards $1 for increased stability.The role of SURF, a token issued to recapitalize USDN reserves, will still exist during the pivot, with 10% of reserves being automatically converted from SURF to XTN when the BR reaches 115%.The roadmap for the pivot to XTN includes the development of functionality in January, the release of a technical litepaper in late January, and a full rebrand of USDN to XTN in mid-February.The addition of $15 million of ecosystem tokens as collateral through governance will occur between February and April.11:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(3:00 UTC) Bank of England Monetary Policy Report12:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(4:15 UTC) European Central Bank Monetary Policy Decision Statement9:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:00 UTC) Australia S&P Global Services PMI (Jan)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Hovers Around $23K Ahead of Fed Decision; Ethereum Developers to Launch New Testnet for Simulating ETH WithdrawalsAll eyes were on the Federal Reserve, as Chair Jerome Powell announced the central bank's decision on interest rates Wednesday afternoon.
