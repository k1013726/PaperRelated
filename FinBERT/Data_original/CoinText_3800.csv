3600,"Ransomware attackers are growing more dangerous, more sophisticated and sharply more profitable in extracting crypto from their victims, according to on-chain data reviewed by Chainalysis.In a new report, the blockchain analytics firm said ransomware-linked addresses have banked at least $81 million in crypto this year after amassing a record $406 million in 2020. Chainalysis suspects the true toll is far higher. New addresses frequently pop up, and victim corporations often keep their ransomware run-ins under wraps.Just last week Colonial Pipeline suffered a debilitating ransomware attack that forced it to freeze a critical oil and gas artery for the U.S. eastern seaboard. Colonial ultimately paid the group, which was using DarkSide ransomware, $5 million in crypto to unlock its network, according to reports.Chainalysis said the prevalence of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) is contributing to the blistering spread of corporate cyber attacks. Under RaaS, ransomware developers essentially license out their software strains and share in their affiliates’ profits. DarkSide generated the vast majority of RaaS revenue through Q1, the report said. Ransomware payouts are also steadily growing. Victims paid an average of $54,000 in Q1, compared to $46,000 in Q4 2020 and just $12,000 average in Q4 2019. There tends to be at least one $10 million ransom paid a quarter, but groups have demanded as much as $50 million.Cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, the top ransomware payout, is inherently traceable because of its public blockchain, allowing Chainalysis to follow the money. It said ransomware addresses spread over 9% of victim funds across fraud shops, hacking tool service providers and even professional negotiator services last quarter to support their extortion efforts. Just 3% of the crypto flowed that way in Q1 2020.But the vast majority of last quarter’s ransomware payouts, over 75%, ended up on crypto exchanges, Chainalysis said. Likewise, the vast majority of ransomware strains appear to emanate from Russia’s sphere of influence. Russian-affiliated cybercriminals “have been among the most prolific in the world,” Chainalysis said, especially in crypto crime. They account for a “larger share” of ransomware activity in 2021.The most profitable ransomware strains of 2021 are hard coded to avoid Russian-speaking victims, Chainalysis said. It estimated Russia-linked strains have taken in 92% of this year’s ransomware proceeds, compared to 86% last year. Law enforcement entities may be targeting ransomware proprietors. On Friday, BleepingComputer reported that federal officials had seized the servers belonging to DarkSide, and the group's crypto appears to have been sent to another wallet.",2021-05-14
3601,"New ways of making money have often generated new approaches to giving it away. With cryptocurrencies now worth more than all the U.S. dollars in circulation, holders face a crucial  question: what kind of donors do they want to be? The rise of cryptocurrencies has forced the finance industry and the world at large to re-examine assumptions on transparency, efficiency and power distribution. And so, crypto donors have an exciting opportunity to not only grapple with the decision of “how much” but also “how.” How, in other words, can they add both to the pool of available resources and ensure it’s better spent?For better or worse, new sources of wealth often change how philanthropy works. John D. Rockefeller, America’s first billionaire, built its first modern foundation. Rockefeller had more money than he could give away himself and set up an entity to give according to a broad mandate long after his death. His peers – Carnegie, Mellon, Ford – soon followed and a new philanthropic tool was born.  Decades later, the personal computing revolution spurred Bill & Melinda Gates to position their foundation as a uniquely influential private player in the public health space. And in the years that followed, wealth from internet companies like Facebook drove the growth of effective altruism (or evidence-based philanthropy), as well as the expanded use of new legal structures like donor-advised funds or L.L.C.s.Crypto donors have already begun to make their mark. In 2018, a person (or persons) calling themselves Pine gave 5,104 bitcoin to 60 charities entirely anonymously. FTX is the world’s only trading platform, crypto or otherwise, that was founded explicitly, “with the goal of donating to the world’s most effective charities.” It donates 1% of its net fees (in 2020, its founder was baffled to find himself then-candidate Joe Biden’s second largest donor).New structures for giving have also developed. GitCoin uses quadratic funding to crowdsource and match funding for public goods in the Ethereum space. And nonprofit Noora Health issued an NFT promising the purchaser a digital claim to the impact achieved through the NFT’s purchase price. This is just the beginning. In a conversation with economist Tyler Cowen, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said if Bitcoin’s price reaches $200,000, half of the world’s billionaires would be crypto billionaires.So how can crypto donors do the most good? First, they can join pioneers like Open Philanthropy Project in helping make altruism more effective. Too much giving still turns on anecdotes versus data. And more of those controlling the purse strings must ask the difficult questions about evidence and impact. As the Managing Director of a nonprofit called GiveDirectly, I believe charities have much to learn from the transparency, efficiency, and decentralized power at the heart of crypto’s potential. The status quo aid model requires donor money to move through a complex web of multinational and local organizations before reaching its end-destination. Both dollars and information are often eroded along the way, and the end-user is too often deemed a passive recipient of goods or services, instead of an active agent of resource allocation.  One alternative is to simply give people money. At GiveDirectly, we have delivered over $380 million to hundreds of thousands of people, including residents in urban slums, refugees, and survivors of natural disasters across 10 countries. Direct cash transfers are not a silver bullet, but they’re evidence-backed, efficient, and have been increasingly adopted as an industry benchmark. Cutting out the middlemen in aid has resonated within the crypto community. People like Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin have joined Pine and thousands of others in sending more than $25 million in cryptocurrencies to people in need through GiveDirectly. Cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology broadly could also help improve the implementation of giving itself better. Smart contracts could implement new approaches to results-based financing, public ledgers could open up new standards in transparent aid, or digital currencies could offer ways to distribute aid despite capital controls or inadequate fiat currencies. Of course, realizing these possibilities will require building with the world’s poorest people in mind (and investing more in those who are already doing so).While crypto donors have important decisions to make about how and where to give, the work begins further upstream within the industry itself. As Teddy Roosevelt remarked about the industrialists’ new foundations, ""No amount of charities in spending such fortunes can compensate in any way for the misconduct in acquiring them."" For cryptocurrency, that may mean tackling carbon footprints, rooting out the scams that prey on its most vulnerable community members, collaborating productively with regulators and tax authorities, or ensuring tomorrow’s financial system includes more diverse perspectives than today’s. Still, if the giving often looks like the earning, there’s a lot to be hopeful about in the rise of crypto-philanthropy. Let’s make sure it delivers on that potential.",2021-05-14
3602,"Bitcoin (BTC) tanked on Wednesday, hitting multi-month lows near $46,000 as renewed fears of an early rate hike by the Federal Reserve, the recent dour mood in financial markets and Tesla's decision to suspend bitcoin payments were all blamed for the slide. But the downward move was likely aggravated by options market makers selling the cryptocurrency in the spot/futures market to hedge their books (offset bullish exposure), according to Fredrick Collins, a seasoned options trader and researcher at Glassnode. ""Market makers were heavily short puts in the range of $52,000 to $50,000, and I estimate were forced to sell nearly 2,900 bitcoin during the crash to offset the short gamma exposure,"" Collins told CoinDesk in a Twitter chat. ""That likely exacerbated the bearish move.""The episode shows how the growing trade in cryptocurrency options in recent months has become a force to reckon with for participants in the underlying spot market for bitcoin, with monthly expiries proving to be a catalyst for price volatility. According to data source Skew, the options market has exploded in the past 12 months, with the open interest rising from $50 million to over $10 billion. Options market makers are individuals or entities with a contractual obligation to maintain a healthy level of liquidity on an exchange. They make sure there is enough depth in the order book by offering to buy or sell a call/put option contract at any given point in time. For example, if a trader wants to buy a bitcoin call at the strike of $80,000 right now, and there is no matching sell order, the market maker will step in to sell the $80,000 call, facilitating the transaction. A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date, called expiry. A put option gives the right to sell. Thus, market makers always take the opposite side of investors' trades and maintain a market-neutral portfolio by buying and selling the underlying asset as the price swings. This act of balancing books is known as ""gamma hedging"" in options parlance. Gamma refers to the speed of change in delta - sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset. In other words, gamma measures the rate of change in the option's price relative to changes in the spot market prices. Holding a long put position is considered a long (positive) gamma trade, as the option starts gaining value at a faster rate with the drop in the price of the underlying asset, thereby making money for the buyer and producing a loss for the seller (holder of short gamma position). According to Collins, market makers were short gamma (sellers of puts) at $52,000-$50,000 on Wednesday. As bitcoin started falling, the negative gamma exposure became a pain: Puts sold at the aforementioned strikes began gaining value, signaling losses for the market makers. Thus, market makers responded by selling bitcoin in the spot/futures market.Data provided by Collins shows estimated dealer inventory fell by 2,900 BTC during bitcoin's price slide. The inventory estimate represents the number of bitcoin shorted in the spot and futures market. (One BTC futures contract represents one coin on major exchanges. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s contract size is 5.)Greg Magadini, CEO and co-founder of options analytics platform Genesis Volatility, agreed with Collins' theory, stating in a Telegram chat that many traders were holding long put positions or bearish bets at $50,000 and $48,000. The theory can be debated on the grounds that the sale of 2,900 BTC worth $145 million at the current price around $50,000 is too small a trade to have a sizable bearish impact on the cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Nevertheless, the fact that traders and analysts are starting to assess the cryptocurrency options market makers' hedging activity reflects the derivatives segment's growing relevance in the bitcoin market. Also read: Fairlead’s Stockton Warns of Bitcoin Correction to $42K, Based on Technical Analysis",2021-05-14
3603,"Argo Blockchain and DMG Blockchain, cryptocurrency mining firms that are publicly traded in the U.K. and Canada, respectively, have joined the Crypto Climate Accord (CCA), an advocacy group that pushes for lower carbon emissions in the crypto-mining industry. The two firms said Friday they are now working with the CCA to develop a new working group to promote the accord’s objectives, while also working to increase transparency around energy sourcing by crypto mining operations.The CCA is a private sector-led initiative that sets out to reduce overall emissions in cryptocurrency mining, which has become a cause for concern for some high-profile investors such as Elon Musk. The organization is encouraging the industry to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.“The Crypto Climate Accord helps lay the groundwork for real, tangible action to address Bitcoin mining’s impact on the environment, and we are both eager and determined to ensure that Supporters and Signatories remain committed to the group’s goals,” Argo Blockchain CEO Peter Wall said.Argo and DMG said it’s estimated that crypto mining worldwide accounts for up to 0.5% of global power usage, though they did not provide a source for the data.The two firms are already working on environmental initiatives, having signed an agreement in March to launch a bitcoin mining pool that would be completely powered by clean energy. On Thursday, Argo Blockchain announced the purchase of two data centers in Canada that are largely powered by hydroelectricity.See also: What Bloomberg Gets Wrong About Bitcoin’s Climate Footprint",2021-05-14
3604,"A closely tracked ratio in cryptocurrency markets known as the ""Grayscale premium"" flipped earlier this year to a discount, and it has widened this week to a gaping 21%, which is the highest level on record, according to Skew, a crypto analysis firm. For retail traders, or anyone with access to a brokerage account, the growing disparity might present an opportunity to buy bitcoin on the cheap, analysts say. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), from the crypto asset manager Grayscale, is the largest U.S. investment vehicle for buying bitcoin (BTC) through a stock exchange. The Grayscale discount represents the difference between the price of the underlying bitcoin assets and the value that's implied from the price of the trust's shares. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.)The bet some traders could be making now is that the discount would evaporate if Grayscale receives approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert the trust to an exchage-traded fund. If that happened, according to one analyst, the shares might quickly climb back toward the price of the underlying bitcoin – allowing traders to recapture the discount as a profit while still booking any gains from the cryptocurrency itself.  “Investors looking for long-term passive bitcoin exposure are probably better off buying GBTC over spot bitcoin since you get paid to wait more via the discount than you pay in excess fees,”  David Grider, strategist at investment research firm FundStrat, wrote in an email.In recent years, when GBTC was trading at a premium, the situation looked much different.Accredited investors – usually big institutional players or wealthy people – could profit from buying into GBTC at the trust's net asset value (NAV). They were subject to a lockup period of six months, but after that, they could then sell their shares for a profit in the open market to lock in any gains from bitcoin and capture the premium as an extra kicker. The 20%-50% GBTC premium also could offset the risk from any potential declines in bitcoin’s price. But that ""Grayscale trade"" wasn't available to retail traders.  Then in March, as bitcoin's 2021 rally stalled and more competition arrived from bitcoin ETFs in Canada, Switzerland and elsewhere, GBTC began trading at a discount to its net asset value, a disincentive for new institutional buyers. Another deterrent was the 2% annual fee. “Much of the discount has been the result of investors expecting a U.S.-listed bitcoin ETF in the near future after the approval of several in Canada,” Grider wrote.Grider’s view assumes Grayscale is successful in converting the trust into an ETF, which is far from assured. There's a risk that the SEC might not approve any bitcoin ETFs or that Grayscale's proposal might not be approved as soon as competing investment vehicles are.   But now that Grayscale is “100% committed to converting GBTC into an ETF,” market confidence could return and potentially unlock roughly $5 billion worth of GBTC shares in the coming months, according to Grider.These unlocked GBTC shares will be available to retail traders at a discount.“Investors who own GBTC could see their shares converge towards NAV,” Grayscale wrote in an email.Another short-term or medium-term risk is that the GBTC discount widens from current levels. “For traders, I wouldn’t be surprised if the gap widens over the next few weeks as a big chunk of new supply comes to the market, but the overhang should start to clear up heading into Q3,” Grider wrote.Digital Currency Group authorized the purchase of up to $750 million worth of shares of GBTC on May 3. Repurchasing shares is a common tool used by companies seeking to increase the price of those shares by simultaneously creating demand while decreasing the number of shares outstanding.  A representative for Grayscale and DCG declined to comment.",2021-05-14

3606,"A Bank of England official has spoken of the institution's plans to launch a U.K. central bank digital currency (CBDC), now often dubbed “Britcoin.”In a speech Thursday, Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability, said it looks “probable” that the state would need to issue some form of digital cash to retain citizens’ confidence in the availability of public money.“The knowledge that under stress depositors have the option to switch into state money may be important in preventing a more general loss of confidence in money,” Cunliffe said.Such loss of confidence could see more consumers “locked into private money”, he said, citing stablecoins launched by Big Tech platforms as an example. These are likely “to have greater functionality and lower transaction costs than the current commercial bank digital money offering and could quickly attract a large number of users.”Thus far the central bank has only published a discussion paper and announced a taskforce to explore a CBDC, so the comments are perhaps notable as a sign of intent.In other news, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, has warned again about investing in crypto assets, soon after bitcoin’s price took a sharp dip under $50,000.Also read: Former CFTC Boss’ Digital Dollar Project Ready to Kick Off First US CBDC TestsSpeaking at a Bank of England citizens’ panel event Thursday, Bailey spoke of the “warning sign” of people looking for investment opportunities in crypto.“You’ve probably seen all the stories about the price of bitcoin, share prices in the U.S. suddenly rocketing up for companies that nobody quite knows what they do,” he said.“Buy it if you want, but it has no intrinsic value,” Bailey concluded, echoing his comments of a week ago when he told a press conference that crypto investors should be prepared to lose all their money.",2021-05-14
3607,"Renaissance Technologies cranked up its exposure to the cryptocurrency ecosystem last quarter, amassing its largest-ever positions in mining stocks, worth over $140 million in total at the end of March.The storied quant fund manager of $115 billion ended Q1 with 1.16 million Riot Blockchain shares ($61.8 million), 1.56 million Marathon shares ($75 million) and 203,672 Canaan shares ($4.2 million), according to Thursday disclosures. Renaissance Technologies has chased crypto mining’s upside since at least 2017 with occasional bets on MARA, RIOT and CAN. But those positions had never eclipsed $1 million, and the hedge fund ended 2020 with no exposure to the crypto mining sector at all.Crypto mining stocks rallied to new heights during the recent bull run, giving U.S. investors a sideways route to speculate on crypto without actually owning any. RIOT and MARA actually outperformed bitcoin at times. The combined positions far outstrip RenTech’s 2020 positions in MicroStrategy, another crypto bellwether stock that raced upward with bitcoin’s rise. In fact, RenTech, which at one point held over $40 million in MSTR, according to The Block, appears to have closed out its MSTR holdings, ending Q1 2021 with no MSTR on the books. In April 2020 RenTech gave its Medallion funds the green light to invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures.",2021-05-13

3609,"It’s Elon Musk’s crypto world. A bearish tweet from the entrepreneur on bitcoin and Tesla reneging on using it as a payment method sent crypto markets dropping.Bitcoin was down 10% Thursday as of press time and going as low as $47,720 around 01:00 UTC (9 p.m. ET). The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.One fundamental reason for bitcoin’s drop: Tesla. Bitcoin’s price has been in a very defined range over the past two weeks but the electric car maker’s announcement Wednesday that it would stop accepting BTC because of environmental issues related to bitcoin mining led to immediate selling that spilled into the next day.“What saddens me is the way the weak hands and recent buyers see Elon Musk as a prophet, powerhouse and decisive figure in bitcoin,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a bitcoin over-the-counter trader. Bitcoin's price has tumbled 17% since Sunday, on track for the worst weekly performance since February. “The BTC chart structure is very weak and there is not any significant positive trigger for BTC to move higher,” said Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani.Some analysts lament Musk's ability to sway crypto prices, with even dogecoin (DOGE) at his mercy. DOGE is down 32% so far this week, after the price failed to pump when the billionaire entrepreneur appeared as host of the long-running comedy show ""Saturday Night Live.""  “If anything, what this is revealing is the sensitivity of the new money in the space,” said Vishal Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. “Right now, the drivers are mostly macro, and hence correlation to other assets is back in the cards.”Tesla’s stock is down 3.1%. Its 2021 performance has been poor, down over 22% so far.In the bitcoin derivatives market, it appears traders are doing less hedging. A Forbes article Thursday points to traders cashing out short positions on CME as bitcoin fell. Data from Skew also suggests a large number of sell liquidations on the futures market occurred during the past 24 hours, maxing at over $400 million in selling around 22:00 UTC (6 p.m. ET) Wednesday.However, traders may want to start hedging more often because Delta Exchange’s Balani expects choppy waters ahead for crypto. “Now there is a clear negative trigger that can lead to a large correction in BTC and altcoins,” he said. “Given a breakdown of crucial support levels in BTC, volatility in BTC and alts is going to be higher.” Read More: MicroStrategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin, Adds Another $15MEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $3,651 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), down 10% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians. Despite the drop, there is at least one long-term fundamental positive for ether: The use of decentralized finance, or DeFi, on Ethereum. According to data aggregator Dune Analytics, Wednesday was the highest volume day in the past month for decentralized exchanges, or DEXs. Uniswap, as usual, led the way with $3.7 billion in volume.While the market may be dipping and volatility may crop up, Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, is focused on the core technologies of crypto and the value they may unlock for a bull case over the long haul. “For many crypto assets such as bitcoin and ethereum, the long-term story has not changed,” said Peters. “This emerging asset class continues to revolutionize many aspects of financial services. And while nothing goes up in a straight line, the long-term fundamentals for crypto assets remain as solid as ever.”Read More: Crypto App Alice Raises $2M for US-Centric Terra DeFi PortalDespite a down crypto day, analysts expect altcoins to continue to flourish. “Overall, the market is now being driven by alternative assets that are able to innovate faster than bitcoin and ethereum,” said Michael Gord, chief executive officer of quant firm Global Digital Assets. “This provides a massive opportunity for new networks to test and build innovations faster that bring over value away from bitcoin and ethereum.”Technical analyst Katie Stockton from Fairlead Strategies likes stellar (XLM) and cardano (ADA), while she is bearish on dogecoin. “Note that dogecoin has assumed an unfavorable trajectory relative to bitcoin over the past week, while stellar and cardano have the best short-term relative strength outlooks,” she said.  Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the red Thursday.

3610,"Elon Musk's concern that bitcoin (BTC) might be bad for the environment isn't enough to derail the cryptocurrency's potential for further price gains, said Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone.""Elon Musk saying Tesla is suspending purchases using bitcoin doesn't shake our thesis that the crypto is in early price discovery days on its way to becoming the global digital reserve asset in a world of accelerating digitalization and electrification,"" McGlone wrote Thursday in a new report. The report follows a 13% drop in the price of bitcoin, the most in a single day in almost four months. The drop was prompted by Musk, Tesla's CEO, saying late Wednesday the electric-car company was ending its bitcoin-for-cars offer made earlier in the year. That Feb. 8 announcement drove up bitcoin's price so dramatically – by 19% – that it was lionized by some fans of the cryptocurrency as ""Elon's candle,"" in a reference to the resulting pattern on price charts.

McGlone is considered a hot hand in cryptocurrency markets because he accurately forecast bitcoin's price rise to $50,000 last year, at a time when it was trading at just a fraction of that level. What matters the most, according to McGlone, is the source of the Bitcoin network's energy. ""The source of electricity is increasing from solar and wind, which are cost effective,"" according to the report. ""On a global scale, electricity is going renewable.""Musk's remarks about the crypto's electricity consumption are ""odd"" coming from an automaker whose product is ""fed solely by electricity,"" the analyst wrote. McGlone wrote that bitcoin ""shows comfort at the whole-number level around $50,000, which was our initial call on a 2021 target resistance value.""""The rule of money flowing to where it's treated best looks like an enduring tailwind for bitcoin,"" he wrote. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands around $48,322, down about 10% over the prior 24 hours. The decline left the cryptocurrency's price up about 67% for the year to date. ",2021-05-13
3611,"Critics of Bitcoin like to compare its carbon footprint to a transaction on your Visa card, ignoring the environmental impact of the infrastructure that sustains fiat money and the enormous collateral damage that fiat brings. These secondary effects make fiat money orders of magnitude more energy-destructive than Bitcoin. You can appreciate fiat’s secondary footprint from any street corner on Earth: 80,000 bank branches and 470,000 ATMs in the U.S. alone, along with forests of skyscrapers that dominate every city on the planet. Then the part we don’t see: Finance and insurance are 8.4% of the gross domestic product in the U.S., only slightly behind manufacturing. That means millions taking the subway or driving to the office – or, the pandemic equivalent, firing up an army of laptops and call centers – to sling paper money under fiat’s harsh fluorescent glow. Visa transactions don’t even come close.And that’s on the good days. Because, when it comes to fiat, there are a lot of bad days. Fiat money has caused a recession every 5.6 years, to be precise, in the U.S. since the Federal Reserve’s founding, by manipulating the pace of money creation that drives the boom-bust cycle. Beyond the human toll, each recession has brought trillions in wealth destruction, wealth that took an enormous amount of resources and, yes, an enormous amount of carbon to create.To translate this recession cost into something that can be compared to Bitcoin, I relied on the most mainstream estimates of the carbon cost of a dollar of GDP – about 5,000 BTU (British thermal units), or 1.5 kWh (kilowatt hour), per dollar. Then, using the Federal Reserve’s own estimate of $11 trillion destroyed peak to trough in the 2008 crisis – the very crisis that inspired Satoshi to create Bitcoin – you simply multiply the two. That comes out to 16,500 TWh (terawatt hour) of carbon equivalence destroyed during that single recession. Accounting for the rest of the world, that might triple. Accounting for the other 16 recessions the Fed has given us – with more to come – makes it astronomical.The modern recession and the boom-bust cycle that drives it is entirely a creation of fiat money. Governments intervene in the allocation of capital, randomly starting and stopping a fire hose of credit that whipsaws the real economy and destroys real lives. Just as the cost of a five-second delay in a footrace can be measured in distance lost, the cost of a recession can be measured by the resources it will take to rebuild lost wealth. Bitcoin, by taking purchasing power out of central banks’ manipulation space, can reduce or even eliminate their ability to cause boom-bust cycles.Even Bitcoin’s worst critics allege the distributed network consumes no more than 86 TWh per year, of which perhaps 16 TWh might be Americans, with much of that green energy. It would take between 500 and 1,000 years for Bitcoin’s energy use to even approach the 2008 crisis alone. With another recession permanently on the way, over and over again. That 500 to 1,000 years’ worth of energy goes on top of the 8.4% of GDP, the 80,000 bank branches and 470,000 ATMs and those skyscrapers.These ratios suggest that central banks are vastly more polluting than Bitcoin, indeed more polluting than the worst industrial offender you could imagine. Bitcoin, by implication, is among the most green technologies humanity has ever invented. Indeed, if Bitcoin even slightly reduces central banks’ ability to cause recessions, it could pay back every watt many times over. For example, if Bitcoin reduces the odds or magnitude of central bank recessions by just 2%, Bitcoin would actually save us far more energy than it uses – it would be net carbon negative. Of course, collateral damage from fiat doesn’t end at recessions. Inflation, business cycles and money printing lead to economic chaos and human misery, bailouts of politically connected industries and fiat-subsidized wars – with carbon footprints and human costs all their own. Fiat money perverts the natural symbiosis between taxpayer and tax collector, whereby governments do well when we do well, by allowing governments to magic up what they need via the printing press. Given we live in a world of irresponsible governments, bankers with senators on speed dial and still-immature altcoins, Bitcoin remains the safest bet for reducing the enormous energy waste and human cost of rebuilding our economy over and over again. Skipping the roof on your new house may be green in the moment, but not if you have to rebuild every 5.6 years. If you really do prioritize the environment, help Bitcoin shut down the most polluting industry on Earth: central banking.",2021-05-13

Friedman said he is also looking for comments on recent partnerships and on regulation. Davidson's Luria will also be watching for how much of the trading volume was institutional versus retail and for any additional information on transaction fees for trading. ""They get paid on trades and they get paid a lot more for consumer activity than institutional activity,"" Luria said. Lisa Ellis, senior equity analyst at MoffetNathanson, said that she is interested to see how Coinbase plans to make crypto brokerage services become more mainstream by possibly forming partnerships with the likes of Fidelity and Charles Schwab. She said that would “go far to de-risk the bear thesis on the stock,” which is that other crypto exchanges could grab customers from Coinbase by undercutting it on price, leading to a race to the bottom on fees.In April, Coinbase announced its users could buy cryptocurrency using their PayPal accounts. The fees  for using PayPal are much higher than other ways of purchasing crypto from the exchange.“There’s like a handful of big retail brokerages and big retail wallets,” Ellis said. “If they lock up partnerships with a few of them, then it goes far to de-risking that.”Ellis added that she is also interested in an update on the Bison Trails acquisition, which could be a “huge area of growth” for the company. In January, Coinbase said it agreed to buy Bison Trails, a blockchain infrastructure company.",2021-05-13
3613,"Bitcoin is once again in the middle of a conversation about climate change and marginal utility. On Wednesday evening, Elon Musk blew a hole through bitcoiners’ hearts when announcing his car company, Tesla, will pause BTC payments. His reason: The societal benefits of bitcoin “cannot come at great cost to the environment.”The electric car manufacturer will hold on to its $2.5 billion BTC reserve and plans to resume accepting the orange coin if/when mining “transitions to more sustainable energy.”There are many questions I, like many, have about this about-face. Did Tesla really not do due diligence on bitcoin’s coal-heavy provenance when moving into the market three months ago? Is the decision somehow tied to “renewable credits?” Can I sue?Musk’s motivations are often impenetrable. But it’s clear this is just the latest front in a longstanding debate over whether bitcoin, a global monetary layer accessible to any and all, is worth the ecological price everyone pays.The world’s second richest man is now somewhere in the middle of a messy continuum between those who think bitcoin is a useless drain on resources and those who might welcome razing the Amazon to build additional mining facilities.He’s also a man with tremendous influence. On Feb. 8, the price of bitcoin jumped 14% after Tesla parked $1.5 billion in the asset. The Musk effect of a single DOGE meme often (though not always) leads to double-digit price spikes. Yesterday, his tweets erased some $350 billion from the entire cryptocurrency market (it has since pared back some losses).Taking Musk at his word, Mike Novogratz said the space-faring, erstwhile comedian has presented bitcoiners with an ultimatum to go green or go home. Musk may be using his influence to achieve what other bitcoin heavyweights – like Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Ark Invest's Cathie Woods – have long promised: to spur renewable energy innovation.It’s an important goal. The bitcoin hashrate, a proxy for its energy consumption, has climbed to record highs during the recent bull run. Reuters reports mining consumers 66 times more electricity than in 2015.Long the preserve of iconoclasts, cryptography nerds and free bankers, bitcoin this year moved into the financial mainstream. It’s no longer isolated from the larger political or social conversation. As long as people continue to like Earth and equality, bitcoin’s environmental and social “toxicity” will dominate headlines.",2021-05-13

3617,"Ontier LLP, the law firm representing entrepreneur Craig Wright’s Tulip Trading Limited (TTL), has been given the green light by a London High Court to serve papers on 16 Bitcoin-related developers in a fight over funds from the defunct Mt. Gox exchange. The Business and Property Courts of the High Court in London gave Ontier, and therefore Wright, permission to serve the developers of BTC, BCH, BCH ABC and BSV, even though they don’t reside in the U.K. The actions stem from Wright’s claim that he owns billions of dollars worth of bitcoin connected to the Mt. Gox hack. The wallet (1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF) is connected to the hack that drained 800,000 BTC from the world’s then-most popular bitcoin exchange in 2014. Wright claims the keys to the wallets holding that bitcoin were stolen from him last year.The defendants are the Bitcoin Association for BSV, Wladimir Van Der Laan, Jonas Schnelli, Pieter Wuille, Marco Falke, Samuel Dobson, Michael Ford, Cory Fields, George Dombrowski, Matthew Corallo, Peter Todd, Gregory Maxwell, Eric Lombrozo, Roger Ver, Amaury Sechet and Jason Cox. “Tulip Trading is, purely and simply, a victim of theft,” said Wright's lawyers in a statement. And they are expecting developers to take steps to restore the lost funds.As detailed in the Particulars of Claim, TTL is ""requesting that the individual developers enable TTL to regain access to and control of its bitcoin on the grounds that they, the developers, owe bitcoin owners both tortious and fiduciary duties under English law as a result of the high level of power and control they hold over their respective blockchains,” according to the lawyers. The lawyers' statement suggests that named developers could issue some unspecified form of code to allow Wright to gain control of the funds. How that would be executed is unclear, and whether any nodes would accept such a deployment is even less so. To do so would likely involve creating a forked coin which, not unlike others before it, would be a different coin from bitcoin. Wright would then have to convince people to use it for it to have market value.Further complicating the case, a law firm representing Danny Brewster, who lost funds in the Mt. Gox hack that ended up in the infamous 1Feex wallet, previously sent a letter that they might take legal action to claim any coins recovered from that wallet on behalf of victims of the Mt. Gox hack. Thus, even if Wright were to somehow succeed in recovering access to the wallets, he may not be able to keep the funds they hold. Wright has also sued various entities, including Bitcoin Core developers, for hosting the Bitcoin white paper, insisting that he is the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, and therefore has a copyright claim to the white paper. Wright is currently facing a legal challenge from the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance, an industry group, regarding these claims. ",2021-05-12
3618,"“Some are born mad, some achieve madness, and some have madness thrust upon 'em.”When the author Emile Autumn wrote this riff on Shakespeare a decade ago, one wonders if she ever envisaged a day when a Shiba Inu-inspired cryptocurrency would sweep the globe. Perhaps, but I have my doubts.Either way, madness has very much been thrust upon us.Dogecoin, a decentralized cryptocurrency, is a “satirical alternative” to the more serious cryptocurrencies, like ethereum and bitcoin. However, it’s important to remember that satire is, in many ways, an exaggerated edifice built upon a foundation of reality. With bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency, Satoshi Nakamoto implemented a highly sophisticated framework for decentralized finance to flourish. Bitcoin is a serious digital currency, and bitcoin enthusiasts tend to be serious people.Dogecoin, on the other hand, is a meme coin. It’s a joke. It was designed to generate a few laughs. Now, however, doge has generated a cult-like following. And Elon Musk has played a huge role in facilitating the coin’s rise in status.On May 7, after climbing more than 26,000% in value since its inception, doge had a market capitalization of roughly $92 billion. With “The Dogefather” scheduled to host ""Saturday Night Live"" the next day, the rise was expected to continue.Things, however, took a nasty turn when Musk, during a segment dedicated to doge, admitted that it was little more than a “hustle.” Almost immediately, the cryptocurrency’s price plunged by more than 30% in value. Twenty-four hours later, obviously feeling guilty about the joke (a Freudian slip?), Musk took to Twitter. He was seeking redemption.The Tesla CEO, who appears to enjoy “breaking” the internet, posed a rather provocative question to his 42.2 million followers: “Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?” And 77% of respondents said “yes.” Almost immediately after the tweet, doge’s value increased by 10%.Is doge the future of finance? After all, fate loves irony. With dogecoin, however, there is just one problem, and it’s a major one. The problem is Elon Musk.If he passes away tomorrow, the cryptocurrency will die the quickest of deaths. This logic, I argue, is also applicable to Tesla. If Musk goes, so, too, will the allure of Tesla.This is why bitcoin, for all its flaws, is a far more stable alternative to DOGE. Nobody knows who Satoshi is. Is ""he"" an individual? Is ""he"" a group of people? Is ""he"" alive? All of these questions are somewhat interesting, but they are irrelevant when it comes to bitcoin’s stability. Whether or not Satoshi is around doesn’t matter in the slightest. Bitcoin is the star of the show. Furthermore, its success is not tied to the sentiments of one individual.Whether or not Musk, the most successful entrepreneur in the world, is serious about dogecoin is debatable. Nevertheless, doge’s value is not. The Musk tweets and the exaggerated value of dogecoin display all the characteristics associated with a classic pump-and-dump scheme. Musk almost single-handedly has artificially inflated doge’s price, but the artificial inflation can’t go on forever. Eventually, like Icarus falling to his death, doge’s price will spiral downward, swiftly and unceremoniously.Now, I understand that it’s very easy to get carried away with the hype. You might have heard about the 33-year-old man from Los Angeles who recently became a millionaire after investing in dogecoin. Glauber Contessoto invested most of his life savings, somewhere in the region of $180,000, in doge. Most people don’t have that sort of money lying around. More recently, a managing director at Goldman Sachs in London reportedly left the financial institution after making a fortune on doge. Like Contessoto, one assumes Aziz McMahon, who was with the brokerage firm for 14 years, also invested a small fortune in the cryptocurrency. This part of the story, somewhat predictably, gets omitted from the “get rich quick” narrative. There is little room for nuance in the world of canine-inspired lunacy.But nuance is the very thing that is needed. Caution must be exercised. A positive correlation exists between dogecoin’s value and Elon Musk’s Twitter activity. If the tweets decrease in frequency, doge’s value will dip. If the positive tweets stop, doge will die.This is the Catch-22 situation doge finds itself in. It can’t survive without Elon; at the same time, doge has become far too reliant on the entrepreneur for “cultural oxygen.” When it comes to whether or not doge survives, Elon Musk will decide. After all, he is the cryptocurrency's judge, jury and potential executioner. His verdict is all that really matters.",2021-05-12
3619,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a state of calm, but not social media. Ever since Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared the pic of his pet goat named Bitcoin on Tuesday, the Crypto Twitterati are abuzz with speculation and predicting a moon shot for the biggest cryptocurrency by market value. But one analyst studying patterns in price charts says the cryptocurrency may suffer a deeper pullback before resuming the uptrend. The prediction is based on the MACD histogram's recent drop below zero (bearish turn) on the weekly price chart. ""The weekly MACD rollover reflects a loss of intermediate-term momentum that increases risk the recent price range resolves to the downside,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk in an email. MACD, which is the shortened form of ""moving average convergence divergence,"" is an indicator widely used to gauge trend strength and trend changes. The indicator's cross below zero is taken to represent a bearish reversal, while a move into the positive territory signifies bullish trend change. Having crossed below zero in mid-April, the histogram is now lowest since April 2018, implying the strongest bearish signal in three years. The MACD has been a fairly reliable indicator of intermediate price action in the past. For example, the cryptocurrency charted significant price declines after the MACD crossed bearishly in 2014, November 2018 and August 2019 (represented by vertical lines in the above chart).Thus, the possibility of a deeper bull market drawdown cannot be ruled out. ""We are watching $42,000 as support,"" Stockton said. Other technical indicators are also pointing to near-term pain. For example, Fairlead's weekly note published Monday cited an active ""sell"" signal from the ""DeMARK Indicators"" as a cause for concern for the bulls along with the MACD's bearish turn. According to Investopedia, DeMark indicators compare the most recent maximum and minimum prices to the previous period's equivalent price to measure the demand of the underlying asset.""With the weekly MACD on a 'sell' signal and an active 'sell' signal from the DeMARK Indicators (mid-April), it will be difficult for resistance in the $62K-$65K area to be surmounted,"" Stockton said in the weekly note. Bitcoin's bull market has already slowed, with prices stuck largely in the range of $50,000 to $60,000 over the past two months. The retail-led rally to record highs above $64,000 seen ahead of Coinbase's Nasdaq debut on April 14 was short-lived. The cryptocurrency was showing few signs of life on Wednesday despite speculation that Facebook may follow the U.S. electric car maker Tesla's lead and add the cryptocurrency to its balance sheet. ""We may see a series of announcements of bitcoin purchases from institutions like Facebook soon,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of the blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, tweeted. ""Institutions have been accumulating bitcoin in the $48,000 to $60,000 range since February.""Bitcoin was trading near $56,300 at press time, having printed a high of $58,041 early today. Buyers have recently failed to keep gains above $59,000, while the downside has been restricted near $53,000.The cryptocurrency may pick up a strong bid if the likes of Facebook disclose or announce plans to invest in bitcoin, as anticipated by Ju. ""The fact that bitcoin continues to fail at resistance at $58,000 is not a good sign, and the visuals now hint at a head and shoulders top,"" said Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at Token Metrics, a cryptocurrency research company.A potential drop to $48,000 would mark the completion of the head-and-shoulders pattern. A break below that level would open the doors to $30,000, according to Noble. That said, both Stockton and Noble are long-term bulls and expect price dips, if any, to recharge engines for a continued bull run. ""With bitcoin and ether, we believe that you should not sell the dip,"" Noble said. ""So, I would focus less on major topping formations and more on horizontal support points to get involved.""

The declining dominance ratio suggests traders are rotating into altcoins such as ether (ETH), which is up about 20% over the past week versus a loss of 3% in BTC during the same period.But not all is lost for bitcoin. Although retail investors have been pouring into DOGE ""and other small-cap crypto assets, BTC adoption has still been growing,” wrote Coin Metrics.It's possible that long-term holders are building conviction as bitcoin adoption grows. The monthly net position change in long-term holders turned positive in April, which suggests profit taking from January is starting to slow, according to data from Glassnode.",2021-05-12
3627,"Ontier LLP, the law firm representing entrepreneur Craig Wright’s Tulip Trading Limited (TTL), has been given the green light by a London High Court to serve papers on 16 Bitcoin-related developers in a fight over funds from the defunct Mt. Gox exchange. The Business and Property Courts of the High Court in London gave Ontier, and therefore Wright, permission to serve the developers of BTC, BCH, BCH ABC and BSV, even though they don’t reside in the U.K. The actions stem from Wright’s claim that he owns billions of dollars worth of bitcoin connected to the Mt. Gox hack. The wallet (1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF) is connected to the hack that drained 800,000 BTC from the world’s then-most popular bitcoin exchange in 2014. Wright claims the keys to the wallets holding that bitcoin were stolen from him last year.The defendants are the Bitcoin Association for BSV, Wladimir Van Der Laan, Jonas Schnelli, Pieter Wuille, Marco Falke, Samuel Dobson, Michael Ford, Cory Fields, George Dombrowski, Matthew Corallo, Peter Todd, Gregory Maxwell, Eric Lombrozo, Roger Ver, Amaury Sechet and Jason Cox. “Tulip Trading is, purely and simply, a victim of theft,” said Wright's lawyers in a statement. And they are expecting developers to take steps to restore the lost funds.As detailed in the Particulars of Claim, TTL is ""requesting that the individual developers enable TTL to regain access to and control of its bitcoin on the grounds that they, the developers, owe bitcoin owners both tortious and fiduciary duties under English law as a result of the high level of power and control they hold over their respective blockchains,” according to the lawyers. The lawyers' statement suggests that named developers could issue some unspecified form of code to allow Wright to gain control of the funds. How that would be executed is unclear, and whether any nodes would accept such a deployment is even less so. To do so would likely involve creating a forked coin which, not unlike others before it, would be a different coin from bitcoin. Wright would then have to convince people to use it for it to have market value.Further complicating the case, a law firm representing Danny Brewster, who lost funds in the Mt. Gox hack that ended up in the infamous 1Feex wallet, previously sent a letter that they might take legal action to claim any coins recovered from that wallet on behalf of victims of the Mt. Gox hack. Thus, even if Wright were to somehow succeed in recovering access to the wallets, he may not be able to keep the funds they hold. Wright has also sued various entities, including Bitcoin Core developers, for hosting the Bitcoin white paper, insisting that he is the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, and therefore has a copyright claim to the white paper. Wright is currently facing a legal challenge from the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance, an industry group, regarding these claims. ",2021-05-12
3628,"“Some are born mad, some achieve madness, and some have madness thrust upon 'em.”When the author Emile Autumn wrote this riff on Shakespeare a decade ago, one wonders if she ever envisaged a day when a Shiba Inu-inspired cryptocurrency would sweep the globe. Perhaps, but I have my doubts.Either way, madness has very much been thrust upon us.Dogecoin, a decentralized cryptocurrency, is a “satirical alternative” to the more serious cryptocurrencies, like ethereum and bitcoin. However, it’s important to remember that satire is, in many ways, an exaggerated edifice built upon a foundation of reality. With bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency, Satoshi Nakamoto implemented a highly sophisticated framework for decentralized finance to flourish. Bitcoin is a serious digital currency, and bitcoin enthusiasts tend to be serious people.Dogecoin, on the other hand, is a meme coin. It’s a joke. It was designed to generate a few laughs. Now, however, doge has generated a cult-like following. And Elon Musk has played a huge role in facilitating the coin’s rise in status.On May 7, after climbing more than 26,000% in value since its inception, doge had a market capitalization of roughly $92 billion. With “The Dogefather” scheduled to host ""Saturday Night Live"" the next day, the rise was expected to continue.Things, however, took a nasty turn when Musk, during a segment dedicated to doge, admitted that it was little more than a “hustle.” Almost immediately, the cryptocurrency’s price plunged by more than 30% in value. Twenty-four hours later, obviously feeling guilty about the joke (a Freudian slip?), Musk took to Twitter. He was seeking redemption.The Tesla CEO, who appears to enjoy “breaking” the internet, posed a rather provocative question to his 42.2 million followers: “Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?” And 77% of respondents said “yes.” Almost immediately after the tweet, doge’s value increased by 10%.Is doge the future of finance? After all, fate loves irony. With dogecoin, however, there is just one problem, and it’s a major one. The problem is Elon Musk.If he passes away tomorrow, the cryptocurrency will die the quickest of deaths. This logic, I argue, is also applicable to Tesla. If Musk goes, so, too, will the allure of Tesla.This is why bitcoin, for all its flaws, is a far more stable alternative to DOGE. Nobody knows who Satoshi is. Is ""he"" an individual? Is ""he"" a group of people? Is ""he"" alive? All of these questions are somewhat interesting, but they are irrelevant when it comes to bitcoin’s stability. Whether or not Satoshi is around doesn’t matter in the slightest. Bitcoin is the star of the show. Furthermore, its success is not tied to the sentiments of one individual.Whether or not Musk, the most successful entrepreneur in the world, is serious about dogecoin is debatable. Nevertheless, doge’s value is not. The Musk tweets and the exaggerated value of dogecoin display all the characteristics associated with a classic pump-and-dump scheme. Musk almost single-handedly has artificially inflated doge’s price, but the artificial inflation can’t go on forever. Eventually, like Icarus falling to his death, doge’s price will spiral downward, swiftly and unceremoniously.Now, I understand that it’s very easy to get carried away with the hype. You might have heard about the 33-year-old man from Los Angeles who recently became a millionaire after investing in dogecoin. Glauber Contessoto invested most of his life savings, somewhere in the region of $180,000, in doge. Most people don’t have that sort of money lying around. More recently, a managing director at Goldman Sachs in London reportedly left the financial institution after making a fortune on doge. Like Contessoto, one assumes Aziz McMahon, who was with the brokerage firm for 14 years, also invested a small fortune in the cryptocurrency. This part of the story, somewhat predictably, gets omitted from the “get rich quick” narrative. There is little room for nuance in the world of canine-inspired lunacy.But nuance is the very thing that is needed. Caution must be exercised. A positive correlation exists between dogecoin’s value and Elon Musk’s Twitter activity. If the tweets decrease in frequency, doge’s value will dip. If the positive tweets stop, doge will die.This is the Catch-22 situation doge finds itself in. It can’t survive without Elon; at the same time, doge has become far too reliant on the entrepreneur for “cultural oxygen.” When it comes to whether or not doge survives, Elon Musk will decide. After all, he is the cryptocurrency's judge, jury and potential executioner. His verdict is all that really matters.",2021-05-12
3629,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a state of calm, but not social media. Ever since Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared the pic of his pet goat named Bitcoin on Tuesday, the Crypto Twitterati are abuzz with speculation and predicting a moon shot for the biggest cryptocurrency by market value. But one analyst studying patterns in price charts says the cryptocurrency may suffer a deeper pullback before resuming the uptrend. The prediction is based on the MACD histogram's recent drop below zero (bearish turn) on the weekly price chart. ""The weekly MACD rollover reflects a loss of intermediate-term momentum that increases risk the recent price range resolves to the downside,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk in an email. MACD, which is the shortened form of ""moving average convergence divergence,"" is an indicator widely used to gauge trend strength and trend changes. The indicator's cross below zero is taken to represent a bearish reversal, while a move into the positive territory signifies bullish trend change. Having crossed below zero in mid-April, the histogram is now lowest since April 2018, implying the strongest bearish signal in three years. The MACD has been a fairly reliable indicator of intermediate price action in the past. For example, the cryptocurrency charted significant price declines after the MACD crossed bearishly in 2014, November 2018 and August 2019 (represented by vertical lines in the above chart).Thus, the possibility of a deeper bull market drawdown cannot be ruled out. ""We are watching $42,000 as support,"" Stockton said. Other technical indicators are also pointing to near-term pain. For example, Fairlead's weekly note published Monday cited an active ""sell"" signal from the ""DeMARK Indicators"" as a cause for concern for the bulls along with the MACD's bearish turn. According to Investopedia, DeMark indicators compare the most recent maximum and minimum prices to the previous period's equivalent price to measure the demand of the underlying asset.""With the weekly MACD on a 'sell' signal and an active 'sell' signal from the DeMARK Indicators (mid-April), it will be difficult for resistance in the $62K-$65K area to be surmounted,"" Stockton said in the weekly note. Bitcoin's bull market has already slowed, with prices stuck largely in the range of $50,000 to $60,000 over the past two months. The retail-led rally to record highs above $64,000 seen ahead of Coinbase's Nasdaq debut on April 14 was short-lived. The cryptocurrency was showing few signs of life on Wednesday despite speculation that Facebook may follow the U.S. electric car maker Tesla's lead and add the cryptocurrency to its balance sheet. ""We may see a series of announcements of bitcoin purchases from institutions like Facebook soon,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of the blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, tweeted. ""Institutions have been accumulating bitcoin in the $48,000 to $60,000 range since February.""Bitcoin was trading near $56,300 at press time, having printed a high of $58,041 early today. Buyers have recently failed to keep gains above $59,000, while the downside has been restricted near $53,000.The cryptocurrency may pick up a strong bid if the likes of Facebook disclose or announce plans to invest in bitcoin, as anticipated by Ju. ""The fact that bitcoin continues to fail at resistance at $58,000 is not a good sign, and the visuals now hint at a head and shoulders top,"" said Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at Token Metrics, a cryptocurrency research company.A potential drop to $48,000 would mark the completion of the head-and-shoulders pattern. A break below that level would open the doors to $30,000, according to Noble. That said, both Stockton and Noble are long-term bulls and expect price dips, if any, to recharge engines for a continued bull run. ""With bitcoin and ether, we believe that you should not sell the dip,"" Noble said. ""So, I would focus less on major topping formations and more on horizontal support points to get involved.""

3631,"U.S. consumer prices rose to 4.2% in the 12 months through April, the fastest pace since 2008, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported Wednesday. The latest reading on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report exceeded economists' average estimate for a 3.6% increase, and it compares with a 2.6% increase reported last month.The CPI report is particularly important for some cryptocurrency investors who view bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation and ongoing currency debasement. However, concerns about higher inflation beyond the 2% threshold could cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, which could weigh on risk assets. U.S. stocks slumped for a third day and bond yields rose after the report. As of press time, bitcoin (BTC) was down 1% since 0:00 coordinated universal time.

3635,"It’s a truism among government officials, from the Bank of England's governor to the U.S. Treasury secretary, that cryptocurrencies can lead to painful losses for hapless traders piling into a risky game.But a new cryptocurrency project in China named LoserSwap apparently seeks to own failure, and the concept is gaining a surprising following. Loser coin, as the associated digital token is known, comes with the trading symbol LOWB – a derogatory term when expressed in the equivalent Chinese spelling. The token works as part of a decentralized platform for exchanging digital assets – similar to the popular protocol PancakeSwap atop Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is a public blockchain network started by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. LoserSwap is also based on BSC, and the LOWB/USDT pair first started trading on PancakeSwap.The two-person team behind LoserSwap recently hosted an online “Ask Me Anything” event, which went viral on the Chinese app WeChat, with fans appearing to warm to the surprisingly candid answers.“We missed out the whole bull run and are too scared to go into the market right now,” the team members said in response to a question on why they launched Loser Swap. “We decided to launch a token ourselves just for fun.”At press time, LOWB was changing hands at $0.002139, doubling in price over the prior 24 hours, for a market capitalization of $120.6 million, based on a circulating supply of 60 billion tokens, per CoinMarketCap data. The self-deprecation culture has deep roots in China, where small, individual investors in the domestic stock market often think they're exploited by big institutions that own the majority of shares. Mom-and-pop investors sometimes refer to themselves as “chives,” a common vegetable in the Chinese diet. The idea is that they’re ripe for harvesting and ingesting by big players, and are resigned to major losses.The project’s website reads like a Chinese proverb on the inevitability of life’s letdowns.“A poor young man from a fourth-tier city in China invited another poor programmer to jointly launch the loser coin project, the token LOWB,” it reads. “This project was established with a zero mentality. On the day of the project’s launch, the two people took out all their savings to add a liquidity pool. The project promised not to protect the market (mainly lacking strength) and not to run away.”Trading patterns in LOWB bear remarkable similarities to the anything-goes, just-for-fun price pumps (and dumps) witnessed in social-media-fueled crazes like this year’s frenzy in the joke cryptocurrency dogecoin, or the stock-trading hijinks in GameStop shares in the U.S. stock market. Just like the vegetable that regrows after parts are harvested, the LOWB price has shown a tendency to keep surging anew because the retail investors in China always return to the market – stocks or crypto – to test their luck once again.Characterizations of the token’s supply – a crucial investing consideration for many investors in major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether – can’t be taken too seriously. According to the project's website, there are 100 billion loser coins outstanding, including 20 billion distributed by airdrops, 20 billion to mining pools and 50 billion for in liquid mining “in the later stage.” The project’s leaders “don’t know how to deal with” the remaining 10 billion, according to the website.Such self-deprecation hasn’t stopped retail investors in China from pouring their money into LOWB. They see the project and its co-founders as straightforward, harmless, one of us.There is already a loser coin fan website  with the name “the head of chives.” Posters on the site repeatedly seek mutual assurances that fellow traders will buy and hold LOWB. They also share ridiculous posts about their experiences losing money in the bull market.One post titled “How to know if you're a loser” listed seven criteria to qualify as a loser, including “loving cheap or free items such as LOWB,” and, “Always feel like you are not fitting in; you always lose money when everyone else is making money.”“Most retail investors don't understand the technology” of the projects behind the tokens, said Jeff Zhang, co-founder of a China-based crypto investment firm BlockArk. “There has been a sense of fatigue and antipathy among them after investing in way too many crypto projects.”On loser coin’s official Telegram group, there were nearly 2,000 active members around midnight in China on Tuesday half-jokingly and half-seriously discussing how they can become instantly rich.“Time for late night snacks,” one user said in the Telegram group, with a picture of an often costly Chinese dish known as “Buddha jumps over the wall,” made with shark fin, quail eggs, sea cucumber and pork tendons. (Chives aren’t a key ingredient, for what it’s worth.) “It looks very ‘winner,’” one user followed up.“You do not look ‘low’ at all,” a second user commented. The derision was palpable.Annabelle Huang, a partner at Hong Kong-based crypto finance service provider Amber Group, compared the popularity of loser coin to the recent affection in China for the shiba inu token, which bills itself as a “dogecoin killer.” The GameStop mania is another easy comparison, she said.“Bitcoin is seen more as the establishment and institutional play,” Huang said. “So people are turning to tokens that are more grassroots.”They just have to be ready to lose. ",2021-05-11
3636,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hinted that the bitcoin market’s volatility may mean it’s not yet ready to support an exchange-traded fund (ETF), though the regulator is monitoring the digital asset sector and is seeking input.Bitcoin is a ""highly speculative"" asset, according to the staff statement, published Tuesday by the Division of Investment Management. The note warned investors in mutual funds that trade bitcoin futures may be taking on more risk than they realize.The warning comes as high-profile funds from Morgan Stanley and BlackRock begin to diversify into bitcoin through adjacent products like cash-settled bitcoin futures and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust. Those bets represent major steps in the institutional adoption trend of the last 12 months. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)While aimed at investors in mutual funds, Tuesday’s note has implications for bitcoin ETFs, which crypto proponents have been hoping to see for years.“The staff, among other things, expect to … consider whether, in light of the experience of mutual funds investing in the bitcoin futures market, the bitcoin futures market could accommodate ETFs, which, unlike mutual funds, cannot prevent additional investor assets from coming into the ETF if the ETF becomes too large or dominant in the market, or if the liquidity in the market starts to wane,” the note said.A robust bitcoin futures market was key to launching an ETF, Bitwise Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told CoinDesk in February.Proponents expected newly confirmed SEC Chair Gary Gensler to oversee the approval of an ETF. There are currently 10 crypto ETF proposals sitting before the SEC, and the agency is reviewing four currently.On Thursday, Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas said the prospect of an ETF “isn’t dead yet, but it just took a nasty blow to the head.”Read more: Buying Your First Crypto? 10 Things You Should KnowSEC staffers will “closely monitor'' mutual funds’ bitcoin positions with an eye toward ensuring investor protection, one of Gensler’s top priorities for the crypto space. “The staff welcomes further input from ETFs and other market participants, particularly input that focuses on efforts to ensure compliance with the Investment Company Act and its rules and promote investor protection,” the statement said.That means analyzing market liquidity, how funds are valuing their holdings, what impacts their positions have on bitcoin futures and the market itself and assessing whether fraud and manipulation might be influencing price. BlackRock’s $27 billion Global Allocation Fund invested $6.5 million in bitcoin futures last year, for example. Morgan Stanley has also given a handful of its mutual funds permission to bet on cash-settled bitcoin futures, though it's unclear if the mega-bank has made any allocations. UPDATE (May 11, 2021, 23:28 UTC): Added details and context.",2021-05-11
3637,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens yearn.finance and eos climbed by over a third in spot price Tuesday. Ether and bitcoin were in slightly higher.The biggest CoinDesk 20 gainers Tuesday were yearn.finance (YFI), up 48%, and eos (EOS), jumping 36.6% as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto market maker GSR, told CoinDesk the jump in YFI, which is a lending and yield service where users can park crypto to make gains, comes from its ease of use. “It’s been the Tesla of self-driving investment management,” Rosenblum said. He also compared yearn.finance’s founder, Andre Cronje, to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. However, Rosenblum had a caveat: ""Crypto moves a lot faster than autos, and others are hot on the trail.”As for eos, Rosenblum pointed to eos creator Block.One’s $10 billion funding to build a new exchange infrastructure subsidiary, called Bullish Global. Eos is a developer platform for DeFi, a rival to Ethereum. Peter Chan, lead trader at OneBit Quant, told CoinDesk he’s concerned about DeFi's continued success on Ethereum, which may be why alternative platforms like Eos are doing so well in digital-asset markets. Growth of the sector seems to still be adding to congestion on the Ethereum network, particularly when exchanging tokens on the decentralized exchange Uniswap. “It’s been quite tough lately dealing with the insane gas prices,” Chan said. “Trading on Uniswap costs more than $200 per transaction now. Crazy.”According to ETH Gas Station, Uniswap is one of the top generators of fees on Ethereum: Users have spent $2 million in the past 30 days paying for transactions to be processed on the exchange. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was trading around $4,068 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), up 0.66% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a bullish signal for market technicians. “Ether has become a household name after having more than doubled since its breakout to new all-time highs in early April,” noted Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for consulting firm Fairlead Strategies. “The rally remains supported by positive short-, intermediate- and long-term momentum.”Ether’s exchange volume, as tracked by CoinDesk Research, was holding its ground. In fact, ether volume for Monday was at $80 billion, while bitcoin was a bit below that, at $78 billion.The last time ether volume surpassed BTC was a week ago, on May 4. Stockton also noted how far ether has come since the start of April, and said its lofty price could be due for a downturn. “We will be sensitive to any overbought downturns, noting that April’s breakout point is 50% below current levels,” she added. According to CoinDesk 20 data, ether’s price closed at $1,968 on April 1.“For the next week it will be critical to see if ETH consolidates around the $4,000 mark,” said John Willock, CEO of crypto custody provider Tritum. “A maturation and solidification of ETH as a reliable underlying network for DeFi to build on top of builds a very strong picture for ETH to push past $5,000 before the end of the month, if not the end of the week.”Read More: DeFi Is Not TradFi: Why FATF’s Guidance Would Stifle GrowthThe price of bitcoin was up Tuesday at 1.3% as of press time. The largest cryptocurrency was above the 10-hour moving average but below the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians. A bitcoin fall during a quick selling period late Monday after the U.S. markets closed seems to have reversed Tuesday. “Short-term overbought conditions are now a hindrance,” noted Fairlead’s Stockton. “The period of backing and filling that ensued in February has created a trading range on bitcoin’s chart within the context of its long-term uptrend.” Over the past two weeks, bitcoin has stayed within a $6,000 variance range quite consistently, between $53,000-$59,000, according to CoinDesk 20 historical data.While some may argue these tight price ranges give bitcoin increased “store of value” properties, the reality is that since April 16 bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has been rising. As of Monday’s closing data, bitcoin is at over 72% in 30-day volatility, its highest level since March 27.Analysts are also keeping an eye on bitcoin’s dominance for a possible move upward. Dominance is still trending down 2% Tuesday, as of press time, and is below 45%, according to chart software TradingView. “In general, I think BTC dominance has room to go up a bit as a correction against the current [altcoin] boom,” said Andrew Tu, an executive from quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. “But that would be short term and medium term. Alts should outperform ETH and BTC due to higher beta.”Read More: Bitcoin Pullback Risk Rises as Whales Resume SellingDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all higher on Tuesday.

3638,"Hedge fund and forex titan Stanley Druckenmiller believes current Federal Reserve policy and U.S. deficit spending are setting the U.S. dollar on a path to collapse. This morning he told CNBC’s Joe Kernen that it’s “more likely than not” the U.S. dollar will lose its status as the global reserve currency within 15 years. Druckenmiller’s comments were focused on the Fed’s commitment to low interest rates and U.S. debt bond buybacks, moves that ultimately support U.S. deficit spending on coronavirus pandemic relief.Druckenmiller’s comments were positive for one group already effectively shorting the dollar: cryptocurrency advocates. With the euro a basket case and the Chinese Communist Party-backed yuan still viewed with suspicion, Druckenmiller doesn’t see another fiat currency that can play the universal mediation role of the dollar anytime soon. Instead, he thinks “the most likely replacement” for the dollar would be a “crypto-derived ledger system.”This is a remarkable set of statements from Druckenmiller, considered by some to be the greatest foreign exchange trader in history: He was the architect, among other big trades, of George Soros’ legendary shorting of the British pound in 1992. Now he’s echoing one of the most fundamental talking points of bitcoin advocates, who have for a decade contrasted the orange coin’s immutably fixed issuance with the propensity of states to let the money printer go brrr.Inflation hasn’t been a major worry for the U.S. economy for decades – in fact, before the pandemic, the Fed regarded inflation as too low for nearly a decade. But pandemic spending has pushed the U.S. deficit and debt to record highs, causing widespread concerns about inflation risk. Inflation can be a major headache for dollar-denominated investors, since it erodes their holdings and gains. It can also be an annoyance for workers and consumers, though wages tend to inflate along with prices.If the dollar becomes less attractive as a tool for foreign governments and global traders, the unwinding of its global reserve status could be downright catastrophic for pretty much everyone in the U.S. Somewhere between 40% and 72% of all U.S. banknotes are believed to be held abroad, and dollars make up over 60% of national foreign exchange reserves worldwide, according to the International Monetary Fund. If faith erodes, attempts to sell those positions could create a vicious downward cycle in the dollar’s value, which would have an array of negative impacts at home.Despite clear longer-term trends in U.S. debt, it’s far from clear that right now is really the time to rein in spending. Druckenmiller argues that the ongoing U.S. recovery is so strong that further pandemic relief spending is unnecessary and even risky – but the relief spending appears to have been crucial to creating that recovery in the first place. In fact, some argue that the U.S. response helped it ""win the pandemic"" by compensating for broad collapses in demand. Some also believe pandemic relief headed off economic damage on par with the Great Depression, which could have damaged the dollar’s international standing as much as moderate inflation, if not more.Druckenmiller doesn’t dispute the importance of relief spending, instead more modestly arguing that it’s time to wind it down. It’s a broadly Keynesian argument: Grow the deficit while the private sector is down, then scale back when the broader economy recovers. It’s also arguably Monday morning quarterbacking because current relief programs, some set to last another six months, were in the pipeline before the success of the U.S. vaccine rollout was certain. It’s even debatable on its current merits – the U.S. real unemployment rate (U-6) is still above 10%, for instance, suggesting there’s plenty more slack in the overall economy.That’s just one of the big disparities in what inflation means at different income levels. As mentioned, it’s investors and the wealthy who generally have the most to lose from inflation, which eats into dollar-denominated returns while also diluting the value of dollars held. Meanwhile, it has been workers, who are less likely to have significant savings or investments, who saw the greatest proportional benefit from pandemic relief spending and who will suffer most when it ends. Druckenmiller’s reserve currency endgame scenario shows one way that irresponsible government spending hurts everyone eventually, but in the short run pandemic relief has made a lot of regular people’s lives much better than they would have been.This is almost never acknowledged in broader discussions of inflation, but it’s clear to see if you contrast current inflation worries with responses to then-President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cut package. The Congressional Budget Office estimated those cuts, which disproportionately benefited the rich, would contribute $1.9 trillion to deficits over 10 years, even accounting for added growth spurred by the cuts.That’s just as big a budget hole as President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan created, but there was barely a peep about inflation following those tax cuts. That’s even more remarkable because the cuts came during a period of economic strength that made them, according to conventional thinking, economically unnecessary and even more likely to be inflationary than spending during a slowdown. Even more puzzling, many of the same people worried about pandemic inflation are simultaneously opposed to Biden’s attempts to partially reverse the Trump cuts.This all points to broader challenges that could come with any multinational reserve currency, crypto-derived or otherwise. While inflation is rightly feared, deficit spending is an important tool for nation-states to meet local political and social needs, particularly protecting the most vulnerable members of a society during crises. In a worst-case scenario, a global currency that totally usurps national currencies would limit a national government’s fiscal discretion to take these kinds of actions. This can be seen in the problems nations like Spain and Greece have weathered after giving up their own currency to use the euro.But for nations that retain viable national currencies, a supranational reserve currency might be more moderating than constraining, particularly if it was accessible to the general public. Right now, the main options if your own currency is being mismanaged are to look for other nations doing it better or to buy gold. But a neutral, anti-inflationary reserve layer could be a much better refuge. If it were easy to buy and hold (for instance, through a public blockchain), distrust in a government’s fiscal policy would be quickly punished via falling currency demand. Meanwhile, governments would still have the flexibility to issue debt denominated in their own currencies when it was truly needed and supported by public sentiment.But it’s hard to see a path there that doesn’t involve serious disruption for the dollar and the U.S. as a whole. The $1.9 trillion in pandemic spending, after all, was added to an existing mountain of government debt to reach the current total of more than $28 trillion. If waning faith in the dollar translates into less global appetite for holding that debt, Druckenmiller says rising interest rates could require as much as one-third of the U.S. annual budget be paid out in interest alone, from roughly 10% right now. That would be bad for just about everybody.",2021-05-11
3639,"The digital-asset management platform Yearn.finance's governance token, YFI, jumped 22% Tuesday to an all-time high in price, joining the rally in recent months of cryptocurrencies linked to the fast-growing decentralized finance sector known as DeFi.  YFI clocked a new high of $78,019 around 14:30 coordinated universal time (10:30 a.m. ET) and was changing hands near $74,500 at press time.The token's price has tripled this year. That includes a 40% rise so far in May, with most of that gain coming in the past 24 hours. But YFI has lagged behind other DeFi standouts. So far this year, the native token of decentalized protocol Aave, AAVE, has shot up 700%  and MakerDAO's MKR. has risen 400%. ""The rally was overdue, given the token's relative underperformance compared to other DeFi blue chips,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. Although the token is still trailing its DeFi peers in price this year, the protocol has seen stronger growth in recent weeks. Just since the start of April, Yearn.finance has more than doubled the collateral locked into its protocol, to about $4.1 billion, according to the website DeFi Pulse. During the same time frame, the total value locked in the DeFi market has increased by 70% to $80 billion. ""Yearn's growth trajectory has been very strong,"" Vinokourov said. YFI has a very small circulating supply, at around 36,000 coins, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. That helps explain why the token, which has a market capitalization of about $2.6 billion, has a higher price than the $56,558 bitcoin (BTC), which has a market value of $1.06 trillion. Ease of use of YFI in a hot DeFi market, in addition to low supply, may be contributing to the high price.""It’s been the Tesla of self-driving investment management,"" said Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto market maker GSR. Rosenblum said he's concerned about YFI's competition heating up, however. ""Crypto moves a lot faster than autos, and others are hot on the trail,"" Rosenblum said.",2021-05-11
3640,"Cryptocurrency markets tend to vacillate between bitcoin-led regimes and altcoin-led regimes. In this view of the category, bitcoin is the original currency and everything else, including ethereum, is an alternative, based on the same principles but with tweaks or additions. The altcoin-led regimes are called ""alt seasons."" Ether's rapid rise since the start of the year (it passed $4,000 over the weekend) has put 2021 so far firmly into alt season, following a the fourth quarter of last year that was led by bitcoin. Timing shifts in momentum between cycles such as these is important for investors seeking to maximize their returns in a crypto bull market. The chart above looks at bitcoin vs. ether returns across bull and bear market regimes. Bitcoin is still the benchmark for all cryptocurrencies (for now anyway), and so we use its price to define the start and end of bull and bear markets.The methodology is simple: A shift into a bull or bear market is defined as a bitcoin price change of 20% or greater, followed by at least 90 days during which the price does not return to its level before the change. It gives us a way to definitively, with a little patience, say what the market regime of bitcoin is – and by extension the entire cryptocurrency category. Methodologies like this are in line with the kind of work we're doing at CoinDesk Indexes.As you can see from the chart, as of May 2, the current cycle wasn't out of line with past patterns. It still isn't. ETH at $4,000 puts returns for ETH at around 340% since its mid-March 2020 bottom. That's still within the pattern for an alt-season bull market, set in 2017. But at $4,000 ETH and $55,000 BTC, the gap between ether and bitcoin puts 2021 crypto markets at the edge of any altcoin season precedent. (To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday, sign up for CoinDesk Indexes' weekly newsletter, ""The Hard Fork"".)One problem with this chart is it's measuring ether returns over bitcoin market cycles. That's fine for now, because ether may be gaining, but bitcoin is still the benchmark. But if the alt-season gap between ether and bitcoin widens further, we're likely to begin to see an erosion of bitcoin's viability as a market benchmark.A more fundamental trend is the change in bitcoin dominance, which we've noted before. Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of bitcoin's market cap to the sum market cap of all cryptocurrencies. Ether's moves this week have pushed it below 45%, testing lows set in 2018.The long-term decline in bitcoin dominance is a one-step-forward, two-steps-back kind of dance across bull and bear markets: In bear markets, a flight out of altcoins into the relative safety of bitcoin; in bull markets, an embrace of added risk that swells the altcoin share of the market.If the trend continues, eventually we'll be looking for broader data sources as benchmarks for the market – the CoinDesk Digital Large Cap Index, for example. That would push crypto more in line with equity markets. Consider that if Apple, the largest stock in the S&P 500 Index, were as dominant as bitcoin, it would be a $16 trillion company.",2021-05-11

3646,"A bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. could be in the cards this year.That's according to Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.""The institutional adoption of crypto is much greater,"" Balchunas said when asked why he thought this year was different to bitcoin's last bull run in 2017 and 2018. ""You have the intense growth of ‘default’ crypto products like (Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust) which are not ideal for retail investors and the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) knows this.""ETFs operate in a similar fashion to mutual funds, but can be bought and sold throughout the daily trading period on exchanges like stocks. Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.Balchunas also pointed to Canada, which approved its first bitcoin ETF in February. At the time, he noted that the approval in Canada was a ""good sign"" the U.S. would follow suit. So far, Canadian financial regulators have approved four bitcoin ETFs. By comparison, the U.S. has yet to approve an ETF for any cryptocurrency despite multiple applications spanning a number of years.""Canada has a history of being like six months to a year ahead of the U.S.,"" Balchunas said.The Canadian ETFs have done well. Balchunas labeled the demand from investors as ""insane."" Within the first two days of trading of Purpose Investment’s ETF, Canada's first crypto ETF, the fund collected over $420 million in assets under management. All four ETFs have garnered $2.3 billion in assets in just three months, he added.Balchunas also pointed to Gary Gensler being appointed as chairman of the SEC. He came to the SEC with experience in fintech and a presumably favorable stance toward crypto because he taught classes on crypto at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Still, Balchunas said that Gensler may have other priorities, given the Robinhood/GameStop debacle earlier this year, which could lead to a delay in a bitcoin ETF being approved. (Robinhood, a trading app, froze trading in GameStop's stock on Jan. 28, a move that drew the attention of regulators, who were concernd that the halt hurt the retail investos who typically use the app.)But, Balchunas said, ""the longer they delay, the more they will effectively play kingmaker as whoever is out first is instantly wealthy. So I think there's a risk of waiting too long, and I think they understand that.""According to Balchunas, there’s been a ""shift"" this year, meaning his team is ""more optimistic of an approval than we’ve ever been.""See also: Bitcoin ETF From 3iQ and CoinShares Tops C$1B AUM",2021-05-11
3647,"Another would-be bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has taken a step toward regulatory review.Cboe BZX Exchange has filed a 19b-4 form, acknowledging its support of Wise Origin's bitcoin ETF application and kicking the process to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Wise Origin, a fund affiliated with investment giant Fidelity, first filed for the ETF with the SEC in March. The SEC, however, needs an exchange partner like Cboe or NYSE Arca to file a corresponding 19b-4 form before it will consider the application.With Cboe's filing on Monday, the ball is in the SEC's court. The agency has an initial 45 days to make a decision on the ETF application.Bitcoin ETF proponents claim such a product would open bitcoin to more investors, namely those who are wary of investing in bitcoin directly, such as retail traders, and those who may be able to invest only in certain regulated investment vehicles, such as some institutional or financial traders.The SEC, the U.S.'s federal securities regulator, is also considering bitcoin ETF applications filed by VanEck, Kryptoin and WisdomTree. All three firms have also filed with Cboe BZX Exchange. Another would-be ETF issuer, Valkyrie, is working with NYSE Arca, which has also filed a 19b-4 form. Four other bitcoin ETF applications and one ether ETF application have also been filed, though they lack the requisite 19b-4 forms. Those include Simplify, SkyBridge, NYDIG and Galaxy Digital (bitcoin ETFs), and VanEck (ether ETF).The SEC has typically taken a full 240 days – the maximum time allowed by law – to evaluate a bitcoin ETF application. In the past, the agency has rejected every crypto ETF application it has received, though industry viewers say this may be the year such an ETF is finally approved.The bitcoin market's growing maturity and evolution in recent years, as well as the possibility that new SEC chief Gary Gensler may be friendlier to crypto than his predecessor, Jay Clayton, are two signs that a crypto ETF will be approved.",2021-05-10

3649,"Stellar jumps by double digits, Dfinity’s ICP debuts on the Coinbase Pro exchange and ether hits $4,200, albeit briefly. Despite bitcoin’s doldrums, data from the futures market shows traders are ready to take on more leverage on BTC.The biggest CoinDesk 20 gainer Monday was stellar, the currency of the Stellar project started in 2014 by longtime crypto entrepreneur Jed McCaleb. XLM is worth $0.68 and gained 10.8% the past 24 hours as of press time. Over the course of 2021 XLM has been, well, stellar; as of press time, the price is up over 435% this year. In October, Stellar added support for the stablecoin USDC, part of an effort to get into dollar-backed remittances.“I think the fact Stellar added stablecoin on- [and] off-ramps helped a lot to boost the price,” said investment manager Constantin Kogan. Analysts struggled Monday to find a reason why stellar is now making double-digit gains other than to say that it’s “alt season.” That’s crypto-industry speak for periods of time where traders rotate profits out of bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies. Older tokens like XLM “are starting to get a lot of renewed attention,” said Zach Friedman, chief operating officer of quant trading firm Global Digital Assets.Another example of this rush into altcoins came Monday from a years-in-the-making project that has now pushed forward to tap what appears to be ample market liquidity.      Dfinity, once positioned as a potential rival to Ethereum but now marketing itself as an “internet computer” with a much broader ambit, listed its ICP tokens on Coinbase Pro, which instantly vaulted it into the ranks of the largest cryptocurrencies.  As of press time, ICP was trading around $277 on the venue, according to CoinMarketCap. “I think right now we are still in the altcoin season,” said Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter crypto trader. Read More: Dfinity’s ICP Token Price Goes Live on Coinbase ProEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $4,016 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), up 4.5% over the prior 24 hours. Ether hit a new all-time high price on Monday ot $4,213 at around 08:45 UTC (12:45 p.m. ET). “Ethereum has been pushing stable growth and hitting new all-time highs, albeit this is being eclipsed by the gains in the alt market,” Friedman said.  On Monday, ether’s dominance, or its share of the total crypto market capitalization, crossed 20% for the first time in three years.Read More: Ether Price Past $4K for First Time, Approaches JPMorgan’s Market Value“We are witnessing a prolonged ether and [decentralized finance] catchup phase after a long period when most institutional interest was clustered around bitcoin,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, partner at investment firm Tellurian Capital. “This shows in the growth in CME ether futures and also in the fact that the move up is relatively orderly.”Aggregated open interest in ether futures hit $10.7 billion Sunday, continuing to sustain above $10 billion even through the weekend, according to data aggregator Skew.So far this year, ether is up over 440% while bitcoin has appreciated 91% on spot exchange Bitstamp. “Ether is currently outpacing bitcoin, in part because investor sentiments are charged in hopes of a more healthy network in the future,” said Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of exchange CEX.IO.“There is a lot of forward-looking excitement for the Ethereum community with protocol upgrades incoming,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “ETH 2.0 is slated to arrive sooner than expected.” “Ultimately, the potential and emergence of a decentralized future is a narrative that is attracting speculators, investors, users and developers across Ethereum and other crypto ecosystems,” he said.The price of bitcoin was down Monday at 3% as of press time and going as high as $59,442 around 04:00 UTC (12 a.m. ET). “Things will keep on going like this until and if bitcoin makes another move,” said Alessandro Andreotti, over-the-counter crypto trader. “Then the altcoin frenzy will stop for some time.”One bullish signal is occurring in the bitcoin derivatives market. On Monday perpetual swaps funding, which is the rate paid for leverage on BTC derivatives venues, is on an upswing, going as high as 0.0987% per eight-hour period on Binance.At least one analyst thinks it is only a matter of time before the bitcoin spotlight begins to shine once again. “Alt tokens will make new highs and significant gains before a final transition into bitcoin as these gains level out,” added Global Digital Asset’s Friedman. “This will result in a push upwards from bitcoin targeting the $70,000 levels.”Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are in the red on Monday.

3650,"Ethereum Classic (ETC), a sibling of the Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, could see steady demand until the end of the third quarter, according to David Grider, a strategist at investment research firm FundStrat. ETC has almost doubled during the past week alongside other altcoins and bitcoin lagged. Bitcoin rose just 0.65% during the same period.“We think there are forced Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) sellers in the market who are also forced ETC buyers that need to cover borrowed positions in the spot market,” Grider wrote in a research note published on Friday.ETCG, a trust product launched by Grayscale in April 2017, trades at a roughly 50% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company. Roughly 2 million ETCG shares were issued between April and May 2020, according to FundStrat. Private placement shares take one year to vest and are likely being released to the market.“ETCG volume has been spiking recently this month as those shares are coming unlocked to the market,” Grider wrote.“Many of these same shareholders are now finding themselves in need of covering their ETC denominated loans,"" he wrote. ""This means that these same investors who borrowed ETC to contribute to the trust must now sell ETCG shares and buy back ETC in the spot market to repay these loans.”Grider said that lower liquidity of ETCG has forced investors to push fund shares to a deep discount from the spot price. Therefore, the demand to cover borrowed positions has likely contributed to an increase in the ETC price.ETC has traded sideways over the past few days after it reached an all-time high around $178 on Thursday.“The stability of the price over the weekend is encouraging,” Grider wrote in an email to CoinDesk on Monday. “I think there’s still a bid to cover that could last until the end of Q3. It could provide some steady demand for ETC.”",2021-05-10
3651,"NBA junkies know Spencer Dinwiddie as the promising point guard who averaged 20 points and 7 dimes for the Brooklyn Nets last season, before tearing his ACL and missing most of 2021. Crypto junkies know him as something else entirely: a longtime blockchain innovator who, back in 2019, suggested tokenizing his National Basketball Association contract. (He eventually held his token sale in 2020, even if it didn’t go exactly as planned.)Dinwiddie later acknowledged that putting his NBA contract on the blockchain wasn’t entirely necessary, but that it served a longer-term and perhaps more ambitious purpose. “It was to future-proof,” he said in October. “It was about what was coming.” And now we have a clearer idea of what’s coming: Calaxy, a mash-up of “Creator’s Galaxy.” Dinwiddie is the founder and CEO. (When healthy, Dinwiddie somehow has time to run the Nets’ fast breaks and also run a company. I can barely manage running the dishwasher.) Dinwiddie describes Calaxy, which is still in beta, as a “social media super app from the future, designed by Creators for Creators.” Calaxy is essentially a cocktail of fan tokens, OnlyFans, Patreon, social media and a supercharged Cameo. Here’s how it works. For fans, you can buy tokens of entertainers and influencers (such as Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott) and then use those tokens for direct access and perks, without the usual middlemen. For creators and entertainers, you can raise funds through those very tokens, and then use the tokens to monetize your direct engagements with fans. As for the blockchain? As Dinwiddie explained in his announcement, “When you scale to an ecosystem that revolves around every individual’s intellectual property and likeness and you want verifiable scarcity as well as lightweight trading and movement, blockchain is necessary.”Dinwiddie has been in the space since 2017, he’s an investor in multiple projects (including Dapper Labs, which developed NBA Top Shot) and you almost get the sense that crypto is not just a side hustle but his true calling. He once described himself as “just a tech guy with a jumper.” Over a Zoom in April, Dinwiddie sat down with CoinDesk to dish on what we can expect from Calaxy, why NBA players are warming to crypto and why creators will flock to the new Calaxy ecosystem. (Hint: It partially involves nudity, or a lack thereof.)What are some of the actual, real-world things that people can do with Calaxy?Spencer Dinwiddie: So, at the onset you'll be able to get very simple things. Like, I'll pay you a dollar to follow me on Twitter. Or, I want a direct message conversation with you. Or, I want a FaceTime call, or 30 minutes of your time. We have a pretty prominent chef on the platform, and you can pay to get 30 minutes or an hour of his time, and he can walk you through his own private cooking class. These things can become customized. So in a 30-minute block of time I could walk somebody through a basketball workout. Slick. Where does the blockchain angle come in?As it scales, we’ll use social tokens as the transactional currency.Can you walk me through how that works?Yeah, so not to dive too much into that, because that’s phase 2 functionality. And right now, every token is pegged to a dollar to make this very seamless. You can pay for somebody to follow you on Twitter, or pay for somebody to send you a birthday message. And everything is pegged to $1. So if it’s $5 to do a FaceTime call with me, then it’s 5 Spencer Tokens. You know what I mean?I think you’re selling yourself a little short, Spencer. I’d pay more than $5 for a FaceTime with you.[Laughs.] Thank you, thank you. No, I haven’t officially set my prices yet. So you have this comprehensive list of features, and you have these social tokens that are pegged to the dollar because people are used to transacting in the dollar. Sure, makes sense.And in phase 2, you get to more live token modeling, with market caps on tokens – and people will be buying more, or buying less, as [the prices fluctuate.]Got it. I imagine it’s tough to start something like this from scratch; how do you get other influencers on board? Is it tricky to explain the crypto concept?First we started with friends and family, who have just kind of believed in us. We probably got 15 to 20 people off that. And this industry is very small, so they all talk to each other. What we’re pitching and talking about is the building of a community. And a lot of these creators can’t get on OnlyFans because of the reputation risks. You mean X-rated content?Right. But what if you had that same feature, which is basically a video drop box, or content drop box – all through Calaxy – and we call it your Fan Club, and you can’t post explicit content. So instead of it being explicit content from Person A, it’s Spencer Dinwiddie's Fan Club or Ezekiel Elliott's Fan Club or Matt James's Fan Club. And it’s all on the up and up. So that’s what we pitch [to the entertainers] – that it’s built by us, for us. And we charge half the fees that other platforms do. And we guard reputation risk as there’s no explicit content.You’re at the intersection of the NBA world and the blockchain world. In the past year or so have you seen a change in the overall awareness of crypto from other players? Yeah, a ton. Everybody’s got their attention and sights set on it right now. With the amount of investment capital that’s flying around right now, everybody wants in. They’re not even necessarily sure exactly to what degree or how they want in, but they just know they want in because they see what’s going on.What do you think has catalyzed the players’ interests? Is it more the bitcoin price surge? NFTs? Top Shot?Bitcoin probably made everybody pick their heads up and say, whoa. But [non-fungible tokens] are really what has everybody rushing in, because anybody with a name or a certain fan following is rushing into the NFT market.And I think it’s going to be interesting to see what happens, because I do think NFTs are for real. But for people who kind of just throw out random NFTs as a cash grab … you’ve got to remember that these things also need an ecosystem to play in, you know?I think so. What do you mean exactly?You can’t go throw out a one-off NFT, and if somebody’s fan following isn’t big enough the purchaser is going to be stuck with that. I don’t think people always realize that. So it’s going to be very interesting to see where the market goes.Any plans to incorporate NFTs into Calaxy?I mean, obviously, NFTs are very immediately on our roadmap, because we know the demographic of people who are on our platform. We plan on having those in the next month or so. But remember, we’re creating an entire ecosystem where NFTs are on display in our platform, or they’re able to be acquired on our platform. There’s a certain utility around it. There’s a marketplace, there’s an ecosystem. So we’re trying to solve for that problem as well. How would that work? Can you give an example?With the Fan Club, when you have these interactions [with fans] you might want to turn some of that stuff into an NFT, like make an NFT from a specific art class, for example. If there is a broader ecosystem attached to this type of thing, we can start to say, “Oh, this NFT is valuable because he did it in this time [or specific context],” versus kind of it being like, “Oh, Spencer wore this shirt on a Tuesday NFT.” You know what I mean?Yeah, it’s a question of scarcity, right? If they say that this NFT is unique and scarce but then tomorrow they mint another one almost identical, then it kind of loses its value?Exactly. What else are you excited about in the crypto world, just in general? I mean, I always shout out my partners. Our three main partners right now are Hedera Hashgraph, Flow and Chainlink. I’m really excited about those. Obviously, Hedera Hashgraph is the layer that we built the whole system on. I’m really bullish on them. And other than that, the main thing I’m most excited about is when we do our own token selling, and when Calaxy Cash comes live and we start to decentralize our governance. I think it’s going to be huge because I don’t know of any other social media platform that’s built on blockchain. And it’ll be done in the most transparent fashion possible. It has all of these functionalities in terms of helping fan interaction and engagement, building an ecosystem. And it has that future focus and sits at that proper intersection.Proper intersection?I would say, you know, not in a bragging way, but to my knowledge I'm the only one [who] really sits in the middle of both industries, with an intimate knowledge of both. I know a lot of guys are getting into [blockchain], but they haven't spent four or five years actually researching and learning what blockchain is, and learning what a smart contract is. So I just think we’re positioned really well, and we have a chance to do something very special.Last question for you. Do you see the NBA doing any other blockchain or crypto-related things?It has to. They developed a council with a couple of the owners on it and stuff like that. I ain't gonna lie, I was kind of disappointed that I wasn’t chosen. Yeah, why aren’t you on that council?! You could be the freaking chairperson.I would have loved to. You know what I'm saying? That would have been a dream come true, to be able to sit on a council with some of the most prestigious people in the world. But, you know, it is what it is. And they’re definitely going to do more blockchain stuff. They have to. They have to. They don't have a choice, really.This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.",2021-05-10
3652,"Hive Blockchain Technologies (HVBTF), a publicly traded Canadian-based crypto mining company, has sold its Norwegian subsidiary, Kolos Norway AS, to the local municipality of Narvik.Under the deal, Hive transferred all shares of the unit to the Narvik municipality along with a $200,000 payment.The company cites the Norwegian government's scrapping of a tax subsidy on electricity that was granted to crypto miners as a reason for the move. This meant that it was improbable that Hive would be able to meet the development conditions of “this greenfield project,” according to an announcement by the company Monday. The land development rights were therefore impaired and written down to a zero valuation from $15 million in March 2019.Hive Executive Chairman Frank Holmes described the situation as “unfortunate,” adding that the deal was made before he and Darcy Daubaras, the company’s chief financial officer, assumed their roles. The company now plans to focus its mining operations on data centers in Sweden and Iceland, which mine ethereum continuously on the cloud, according to the announcement.

This is the fastest network in history to $1 trillion, right on the heels of the FAANGs that took 15 to 20 years depending on which one you look at.”FAANGs refers to the stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet. The bitcoin market hit $1 trillion in value earlier this year, 12 years after its creation.Yusko based his bitcoin target on equivalence with gold, which has a market capitalization of $4 trillion. If BTC reaches that level, each coin would be worth $250,000.Comparisons with gold are often used to illustrate bitcoin’s upside, but critics cite limits on the crypto's ability to scale such as the time it takes to settle transactions and the computing power required to mine bitcoin as reasons to be skeptical.“What people miss is this is a technological evolution of computer power that isn’t going away,”  Yusko said. “It is a powerful computing network that is going to become the base layer protocol for the internet of value.”See also: Veteran Analyst Peter Brandt Expects Bitcoin to Reach $200K",2021-05-10

The number of unique active ether addresses, either as sender or receiver, rose to a record high of 7.94 million on Sunday, topping the previous peak of 7.14 million reached on Jan. 16, 2018, according to data provider Glassnode.The tally has increased by more than 100,000 in the past three days alone, taking the year-to-date growth to 86%.""Ethereum network fundamentals that include ... transactions, active address, fee collection and many other metrics are making ether fundamentally strong,"" Shivam Thakral, CEO of India-based crypto exchange BuyUcoin, said.Active Ethereum addresses and daily transaction count bottomed out in early 2020 and have been rising ever since, signaling the potential for a bull run in ether. ""When there’s greater usage of a cryptocurrency, there’s more demand, and that drives the price up,” Chainalysis economist Philip Gradwell told CoinDesk last year. Ether, the native token of Ethereum, has responded positively to the network growth, rising by a staggering 2,355% since early 2020.

Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, is trading near $58,200, representing a 100% year-to-date gain.Since the first quarter of this year, the network has been facing congestion and charging relatively higher transaction fees than rivals like the Binance Smart Chain.So far, however, high fees have largely failed to deter users, as evidenced by the continued rise in the active addresses and transaction count (now also at record highs). That's a sign of real fundamental growth, according to analysts.""Low-fee chains can fake activity much more easily than chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin,"" said Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain data company Nansen. ""So when active addresses on Ethereum are at record highs, that's a true sign of organic growth.""Arash Ghaemi, director of the strategy at Two Prime Digital Assets, foresees a further increase in active user participation, as web search data shows popular interest in Ethereum is rising.""Ethereum searches are going parabolic while Bitcoin searches drop/level off,"" Ghaemi said in a Twitter thread on Monday.

3658,"Ether's price, already up a dizzying five-fold this year, extended its climb early Monday, pushing past the psychological milestone of $4,000 for the first time.Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall by market cap, went as high as $4,070 shortly after 3:00 UTC (11 p.m. Sunday ET), according to CoinDesk 20 data. The year-to-date return is now around 435%, versus about 104% for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency.  This year's gains have been powered by speculation from new market entrants betting on decentralized finance (DeFi), which consists of blockchain-based trading and lending platforms that aim to automate many functions of banks and other traditional financial firms. The Ethereum blockchain serves as the foundation for much of DeFi, and it also is the basis for many non-fungible tokens (NFT), another hot trend in cryptocurrency markets. Ether's market capitalization now stands at roughly $470 billion, approaching the $488 billion stock-market valuation for JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank. Of course, it's no joke that cryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile in price, prompting warnings that investors should exercise caution.  Some investors are apparently paying up for ether, to the extent that a premium has appeared on the U.S.-based Coinbase exchange over prices quoted on other major exchanges, according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto data firm CryptoQuant. Ju told CoinDesk via Telegram that the premium was ""significant"" as ether climbed a staggering 72% over the two-week period from April 26.  The market for ether has become so ebullient that crypto derivatives exchange Deribit just listed an options contract expiring in March 2022 with a strike price of $50,000. The level is so far above the current price that the exchange later tweeted that there was ""nothing frothy about us listing this strike"" and that the decision fell within its ""strict listing policy."" Additional excitement has come from the Ethereum blockchain's plan to shift toward a ""proof-of-stake"" consensus mechanism – how transactions across the network are confirmed – that theoretically will be less energy-hungry and more scalable than the current ""proof-of-work"" system, which is similar to what the Bitcoin blockchain uses.

3659,"You might have noticed some green squares floating around Twitter. Like the laser eyes, they are part of the insider signaling that creates a sense of cause and belonging. Unlike the laser eyes, they are not directly about the price – they signal support for the proposed Taproot upgrade for the Bitcoin network.What is Taproot and why is it important? It’s not just the benefits the upgrade brings, which are significant. Taproot is important because it reminds us of what Bitcoin is.Before we dive into why this matters, let’s look at some of the main benefits of the proposed upgrade:With all of the above, Taproot is the most significant upgrade to the Bitcoin network since the block size increase of 2017. The relative infrequency of Bitcoin upgrades highlights one of its main features: It is robust.Making any amendments to Bitcoin is hard. There is no one ""in charge” who can decide what changes get pushed through. And achieving consensus among such a diverse and dispersed group of participants is a challenge, to say the least. That Taproot is more or less unanimously supported highlights what a big deal this upgrade is.What has turned out to be contentious, however, is the method of the upgrade. In March, a compromise was reached in the form of a “Speedy Trial,” which gives miners a series of two-week blocks in which to signal support for Taproot.This kicked off last Saturday, with the most recent difficulty adjustment. From that moment, Bitcoin miners had until the next difficulty adjustment (two weeks later) to signal support for the Taproot upgrade in their mined blocks. If 90% of processed blocks signaled support, the upgrade would get “locked in” for activation in November.On Tuesday, however, it became apparent this signaling round wasn’t going to be successful. With almost 25% of the window’s blocks processed by around mid-day, 20% had not signaled support, so the 90% threshold was out of reach.This is not a big deal – rather than rejection of the idea, it’s more likely that miners hadn’t yet gotten their heads or their software tweaks around the necessary steps. The next two-week window of signaling opportunity is coming up, and if that is also unsuccessful the network tries again and so on until Aug. 11. If by that date 90% signaling has not been achieved, Taproot goes back to the drawing board.So, the Taproot upgrade will boost Bitcoin’s functionality and potentially broaden its market. That’s good for its prospects and its valuation.But here’s the most important impact for the investing market overall: it reminds us that Bitcoin is a technology.Many investors see bitcoin as a store of value. Others are drawn in by the volatility. Most tend to overlook one of the Bitcoin system's most defining features – it is a relatively new technology, with all the upside that implies.When you buy gold, you don’t wonder how it will evolve while in the vault. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does evolve. It did so in 2017, and it will most likely do so again this year.“Technology” implies risk, though – things can go wrong, code has bugs and/or unintended consequences. That’s why it is key that Bitcoin’s upgrades are few and far between, because they need to be carefully vetted and tested. Also, because there is no central body to decide on Bitcoin upgrades, they need to be agreed upon by all the key stakeholders. Consensus is always extremely difficult to achieve.This is a good thing. There’s over $1 trillion of market value riding on the Bitcoin network now, not to mention the valuation of all of the businesses built to support the network, so the risk needs to be minimized to an almost negligible level.Taproot drives home that bitcoin may be an excellent store of value, and it may provide good returns for speculators – but the cryptocurrency also represents the opportunity to get in early on a transformative technology investment. It’s like being able to take an early stake in a hot startup, but with much more liquidity and less paperwork.So Taproot will not only improve Bitcoin’s usability, which could have the effect of broadening its market and therefore potentially its value as well. It also reminds us of one of Bitcoin’s core characteristics, which seems to have gotten drowned out in the prevailing market-driven narratives of late. Bitcoin is still a new technology, and its potential upside comes from more than its supply schedule, its inflation resistance and its decentralization.You may be sick of hearing about it, but we can’t not talk about dogecoin this week. It does feel like the sentiment has morphed from “Hee hee, this is fun!” to “Oh no, we’re going to get into trouble.” It’s like having a party at your parents’ house when they’re away for the weekend, only to have it spin totally out of control.The dogecoin concern is not unfounded: A price increase of over 15,000% so far this year, on objectively poor fundamentals (concentration of ownership, relatively weak security and narrow fully synced node distribution for starters) is fine until someone gets hurt.When (if?) that happens, will the out-of-pocket investors cry foul and demand intervention? If so, will the intervention materialize?What could the regulators do? Insist that investors only invest in things with solid fundamentals? Such as?Could they insist that even more warnings be sprinkled about? What would these warnings say, and would they just be on dogecoin? If so, why? If not, would people even listen?I suppose the authorities could publicly speak out against such speculation. Oh wait – they did that.This is the regulators’ dilemma: They have to protect the investor, but they also have to encourage markets and innovation. How can they do both in a market fueled by sentiment? Do they restrict the sentiment or the market? How would they go about doing either effectively?Part of the intensification of the attention frenzy is the appearance of Elon Musk on ""Saturday Night Live"" (which has not yet aired when I am typing this, but will have aired by the time this newsletter lands in your inbox), which he teased along with the epithet ""The Dogefather."" So we’re expecting some Shiba Inu references, which, given Elon’s power among the meme crowd, could move the price even more. [But ultimately did not.]Should the regulators go after Elon for talking about dogecoin? Public figures often talk about their investments – should that be banned? When does that morph from protecting the public to restricting speech? At the risk of sounding ingenuous, Elon is not out there touting dogecoin’s fundamentals. Should he be banned from talking about things he finds fun?When the economic value of an investable asset is driven entirely by collective enthusiasm as well as meme amplification on social media, then what, really, can regulators do? How do you damp said enthusiasm without trampling on fundamental human liberties, which will ignite the crypto crowd even more?What’s more, it seems like both access to the asset and its potential use case are broadening. Crypto exchange Gemini and multi-asset brokerage platform eToro now offer dogecoin trading. The Oakland Athletics has become the first Major League Baseball team to accept dogecoin for tickets to games. And the American Cancer Society now allows dogecoin donations.If all these questions are giving you a headache, imagine how those of us who need to explain this feel. It’s enthralling but also disconcerting, and reconciling the two is a struggle.Personally, I believe fears the regulators will come down hard on the crypto industry are overblown. Yes, people will lose money when the dogecoin market corrects, and that’s a huge pity. But that happens outside of cryptocurrencies, too. And U.S. regulators are no doubt aware that interfering with personal choice and financial freedom generally doesn’t end well.As Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV, “If [investors] are just having fun, they can do that as well. But don't come complaining to the government if you lose your money.”Sports are mainstream. Crypto assets are not (yet). So the deepening relationship between the two is an intriguing development that will help crypto reach more mainstream markets and help sports teams and athletes appear more “cutting edge.” And, of course, there’s the potential income.The overlap mainly comes from two intriguing trends:Both saw a handful of examples this past week:I’m starting to get the uncomfortable feeling I may have to begin learning about team sports to keep you up to date with potential market-moving trends. This could end up reshaping my weekends.Galaxy Digital has agreed to buy BitGo, the U.S.-regulated crypto custody specialist, for $1.2 billion in stock and cash. TAKEAWAYS:Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) was in the crypto news twice this week: once when it announced a new desk that will offer trading in bitcoin derivatives (non-deliverable forwards), and then again when it emerged as a lead investor in the latest raise for crypto data aggregator and index provider Coin Metrics. TAKEAWAY: In our write-up of the Coin Metrics raise, we quoted a Goldman Sachs executive as saying, “Our clients will greatly benefit from Coin Metrics' institutional-grade data insights and emerging risk management tools."" Could this be a teaser of more services to come?Investment management firm VanEck has filed with the SEC for an ether-based exchange-traded fund. TAKEAWAY: If approved, this would be the first ether ETF in the U.S. That’s a big “if” because the SEC has yet to approve a BTC ETF. Canada, on the other hand, has approved several BTC and ETH ETFs. Might the SEC approve a BTC and ETH ETF at the same time? It’s possible, but the U.S. regulator has spent years getting familiar with the bitcoin markets – its surveillance, price transparency, liquidity, etc. – and it’s not clear that it has the same level of knowledge about ether’s markets, which are complicated by the upcoming technology shift to Eth 2.0.Square’s (NDAQ: SQ) Cash App generated $3.51 billion of revenue from its bitcoin operation in Q1 and $75 million of gross profit, both up approximately 11x from Q1 2020. TAKEAWAY: This kind of result is likely to make other payments services sit up and take notice. PayPal has already started down this road. Who’s next?Among large Wall Street banks, it seems Citi (NYSE: C) is next. The global financial institution is reportedly considering launching crypto trading, custody and financing. TAKEAWAY: This is a reminder that institutions are increasingly asking their traditional banks for crypto services. There are several institutional-grade, crypto-first services that have good track records. But let’s face it, many institutions are going to prefer to deal with a name they already know, trust and have accounts with. This is unlikely to divert business away from the current roster of institutional crypto services; rather, it is likely to continue broadening the pool of participating deep-pocketed investors.Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent of investment manager Grayscale and also of CoinDesk, has authorized the purchase of up to $750 million worth of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), up from a $250 million level previously announced. TAKEAWAY: This is a smart move for two main reasons: one, it should act as a boost to the market of GBTC as well as to investor interest in the product, which has effectively dried up as a result of the post-lockup trading discount to NAV; and two, if the trust gets converted into a redeemable ETF, as Grayscale has said it intends to pursue, then there’s a nice profit for DCG.Listed fintech company Mogo (NDAQ: MOGO) revealed it has bought approximately $405,880 worth of ETH and almost $600,000 worth of BTC as part of its plan to allocate up to 5% of its cash and investment portfolio in cryptocurrencies. TAKEAWAY: Much has been written about the role of BTC in corporate reserves – I have written about the likelihood of companies starting to hold ETH as well. So far, few companies have revealed ETH balance sheet positions, Meitu being a notable exception. I expect we’ll see more of this in the coming months, although I maintain my position that ETH is better suited to a working capital holding than a store-of-value treasury asset.S&P Dow Jones Indices has launched its first three cryptocurrency indexes: SPBTC (which measures BTC’s performance), SPETH (the same for ETH) and SPCMC (a combination of the two). TAKEAWAY: This is a notable move in that a known name, trusted by institutions and product issuers, is investing resources in the crypto markets in the form of indexes that could broaden the range of crypto products in the markets.",2021-05-09
3660,"""I'm really excited for my Mother's Day gift,"" deadpanned Maye Musk, mother of billionaire Elon Musk. ""I just hope it's not dogecoin.""""It is,"" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO joked.Musk, the billionaire trying to ferry people to Mars and build electric cars for Earth, hosted NBC’s ""Saturday Night Live"" program on, uh, Saturday night. As expected, the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin came up. During the ""Weekend Update"" segment (a parody of news shows), Musk explained cryptocurrency generally to the NBC show's audience, before hosts Michael Che and Colin Jost repeatedly asked him, ""What is dogecoin?""So ""it's a hustle,"" Che said after Musk noted that dogecoin began as a joke (Musk said it is, and then said it's going to the moon). Musk was introduced as a cryptocurrency expert named “Lloyd Ostertag.”In the show's final sketch, Musk joked about creating a currency based on ""whatever I say,"" before the show (briefly) explained the fiat monetary system.Doge traded hands at $0.50 as of press time, falling 22% after the show began at 11:30 p.m. New York time. On a 24-hour basis, it was down nearly 30%.Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency Musk is fond of tweeting about, has gone on a tear this year, up more than 130-fold. From Sunday through Saturday evening, just before the show started, the DOGE price had jumped 73%, ostensibly on speculation the joke token might get a boost from Musk's appearance on ""SNL."" Barry Silbert, the founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), disclosed Saturday the company is betting dogecoin's price will fall. DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.Many of the recent price pumps have been attributed to Musk: There is often a sharp increase in price immediately after he tweets about it. While the cryptocurrency was started as a joke, its rise this year has outstripped much of the broader digital-asset market. Bitcoin, for example, has doubled this year, so DOGE has gained some 65 times faster.  As a result, the Shiba Inu-represented crypto now has a market capitalization of more than $80 billion, roughly on par with France's largest bank, BNP Paribas, despite there still being just a few outlets so far that accept DOGE for payment. Still, acceptance seems to be growing. For instance, the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks, which accepts the cryptocurrency for merchandise.Despite Musk's Twitter support for dogecoin, perhaps it's telling that he hasn’t actually put any of his company’s money in that cryptocurrency – unlike his buying bitcoin. Musk’s Tesla put $1.5 billion in bitcoin on its balance sheet, later selling $272 million worth during the first quarter of this year. This week Musk warned his Twitter followers to “invest with caution” this week, saying crypto should be considered a fun speculation tool. “People should not invest their life savings in cryptocurrency, to be clear,” Musk said. “I think that’s unwise.”UPDATE (May 9, 2021, 05:05 UTC): Updated with information from additional sketches.",2021-05-09

3662,"Bad news became good news on Friday for risk assets from stocks to bitcoin. The U.S. economy added 266,000 jobs in April, missing estimates of a 1 million gain. The weak jobs report reinforced expectations of continued easy money policy at the Federal Reserve, which sent bitcoin (BTC) higher by about 2% over the past 24 hours. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also ended the day in the green while safe havens such as Treasury bonds sold off. The April jobs miss suggests a fragile economic recovery, which means easy money from the Fed could continue to fuel the rally across risk assets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stated that rising inflation is transitory and whether the U.S. central bank's tightening policy will depend on a variety of factors including labor market conditions.“The reaction from bitcoin is undeniable,"" said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, in his daily newsletter. ""Even gold and silver hit fresh highs."" Speculation is prompting funds to flow beyond bitcoin as altcoins take the lead.Read More: Ethereum Classic’s ‘Irrational’ Price Tripling Bears Hallmark of Dogecoin Frenzy“During the last round of stimulus, there was a lot of talk about people putting the funds directly into bitcoin. This time, it’s dogecoin,” according to Greenspan.Bitcoin bounced above $57,000 around the time of the release of the U.S. jobs report. The cryptocurrency was trading around $58,000 at the time of writing and is holding support on intraday and daily time frames. Technical charts imply that bitcoin will likely trade higher over the weekend and through next week, although further momentum is needed to push prices past $60,000. For now, as bitcoin consolidates, traders are turning their attention to altcoins. It’s definitely altcoin season, evidenced by the bitcoin dominance ratio declining below the 50% threshold. The ratio measures the total market cap of BTC versus the market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin dominance is currently at the lowest level since July 2018. “Historically, bitcoin reaches its all-time-high and then drops, which starts an alt season,” wrote Adam Morris, co-founder of Crypto Head, a cryptocurrency education website, in an email. “It’s coins like this that are first to drop 95% in a market crash, which has already happened in the 2018 crash,” wrote Morris referring to the popularity around dogecoin, which is now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. “On the other hand, it's likely that ethereum will keep rising and if history repeats itself we'll probably see it all-time-high towards the end of the year,” Morris wrote.Ether futures volume approached $1 billion on Tuesday as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap broke above $3,500. ETH is up about 28% over the past seven days compared to BTC’s gain of 1.5%. Higher volumes in the futures market suggests growing interest from sophisticated traders who wish to hedge or speculate on price movements.In the options market, traders anticipate higher ETH volatility relative to BTC, evidenced by the one-month ETH-BTC implied volatility spread. Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly higher Thursday.

3663,"Ethereum classic (ETC), the not-really-like-ether (ETH) sibling of the Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, is on track for the best weekly performance in its four-year history, with prices nearly tripling since Sunday. Analysts in the digital-asset market say the price move likely reflects a speculative fever among retail traders rather than deeply informed bets on the Ethereum Classic blockchain’s future technological potential. The dynamic might show that the just-for-fun yucks of trading the joke token dogecoin (DOGE) (which bears the hallmark of this year’s frenzy in GameStop shares on Wall Street) might be spilling over to almost-left-for-dead cryptocurrency projects from the last big bull market in 2017. Few professional cryptocurrency-market analysts see Ethereum Classic as possessing the disruptive potential of Ethereum or other up-and-coming blockchains like Binance Smart Chain or even Cardano. But to retail traders looking to bet on price-go-up, the ETC tokens might be looking pretty good, and cheap. “I think a lot of the interest has to do with the fact that dogecoin has moved so much and U.S. retail is looking for the next big asset,” Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of crypto data firm The TIE, which tracks social media interest in digital-asset markets.At press time, ethereum classic is changing hands at $133.72, up 7.96% in the past 24 hours.Ethereum Classic was born out of a contentious split from Ethereum in 2017, known in blockchain lingo as a “hard fork."" However, it quickly lost the support of the larger Ethereum software-developer community and has never attained a similar level of respect among industry executives and investors. The project’s market capitalization is less than one-twentieth of Ethereum’s $409 billion and it has been the victim of several 51% attacks. Yet, that hasn't stopped ETC's price from shooting up for eight straight days in the current bull market. For instance, the ETC price rose 47% on May 5, according to data from Coinbase and TradingView.The ETC growth is also supported by trading activity: Trading volume for ethereum classic on Thursday surged above $10 billion on Upbit, a Korean cryptocurrency exchange, according to data from CoinMarketCap.“It’s a crazy, irrational market now,” Ki Young Ju, the chief executive of South Korea-based blockchain data firm CryptoQuant, said. “People will learn.”Bitcoin’s rally since the beginning of last year could be mainly attributed to institutional investors in North America. Some of them have argued that bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency (with a market capitalization of about $1.1 trillion) might work well as a hedge against inflation in the wake of trillions of dollars of coronavirus-prompted monetary stimulus from central banks around the world. Ethereum classic’s gains, by contrast, appear to be largely driven by retail investors in both the West and East, according to analysts. That’s similar to the driving force behind the meme-centered dogecoin. The TIE’s Frank says he noticed ethereum classic was trading at more than a 50% premium on U.S.-based, retail-focused crypto trading platforms including Robinhood and Coinbase, compared with prices at roughly the same time on other native cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance. The observation suggests rising demand for the ETC token from retail investors in the U.S.“If institutions were behind the move, I don't think you would have seen such a large spread in price between major exchanges with the retail-focused platforms having such a significant price premium,” Frank said.The number of tweets about ethereum classic and bitcoin cash (BCH), a token created from a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, has soared in the past week, another indication “a mass market” could be behind the outperformance, said Frank.Robinhood currently supports seven cryptocurrencies on its platform: bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin sv (BSV), dogecoin, ether, ethereum classic and litecoin (LTC), according to its website. Among those, only ETC and dogecoin have outperformed both bitcoin and ether on a year-to-date basis.In South Korea, where ETC’s trading volume is surging on the Upbit exchange, investors behind the rally are only looking at profits in the short term, Ju said.“There are no institutional investors in Korea,” Ju said. “Koreans are seeking cheap coins that look likely to be pumped.”Analysts expressed concern investors would get hurt eventually by the recent speculative fervor in these lesser cryptocurrencies. After the pump comes the dump, the thinking goes. “Investors will get burned at some point, but this could go on for a while,” Frank said.Thursday on Twitter, @SecretOfCrypto, who has more than 176,000 followers, tweeted that cryptocurrency markets are in a phase where ether has outperformed bitcoin and new money has started flowing into other large-cap tokens seen as having more room to spike in price.“Memes are everywhere,” according to the tweet. “Everyone is super excited and you feel the mania in the air.""",2021-05-07
3664,"Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are transforming the world of finance. More than 21 million U.S. adults own assets like bitcoin or ethereum, crypto credit cards are growing in popularity, and artists are making thousands of dollars selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These products and positions all raise tax implications that too often go unconsidered. Purchasing an NFT with bitcoin? Taxable. Trading your dogecoin for ethereum? Taxable. Using your staking income to buy a coffee from a vendor accepting crypto? Taxable.You get the idea. Taxes around cryptocurrency can be complicated. Whether you’ve just started dabbling in the world of crypto or you're a long-time believer, it’s important to understand how cryptocurrency tax reporting works so that you can stay compliant and enable this transformative innovation to continue to thrive.There’s a common misconception that you have to report crypto taxes only when you sell your crypto for fiat currency. While that is indeed a taxable event, it’s not the only activity that you need to include on your return.For most people who invest and trade cryptocurrency, it’s taxed as property much like stocks. That means you’ll have to report capital gains or losses on Form 8949 for the following activities:It’s also possible to have received cryptocurrency as income. These interactions will need to be reported on a separate part of your return:Failure to report any of the taxable events will likely result in an Internal Revenue Service audit. For the first time this year, the IRS has placed a question at the top of Form 1040 that asks “[a]t any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”  So, if you’ve done any of the above taxable crypto activities, it’s in your best interest to answer that question honestly and report your taxes on the proper forms. It should be noted that more and more exchanges are starting to report crypto activities to the IRS through From 1099-B, which means the IRS is already aware of some of your activities.Good news! Just because you own crypto doesn’t mean you owe taxes. If you bought crypto and haven’t disposed of it, you have no taxable activity to report. Nontaxable activities include:While donating cryptocurrency is not a taxable event, it is recommended that you do report the donations on your tax return because you may be eligible for the itemized charitable deduction.Cryptocurrency provides the unique opportunity of being able to appreciate wealth over time while saving money on taxes. Because wash sale rules don’t apply to cryptocurrency, you can enjoy the tax advantages of offsetting taxable gains with investment losses and immediately buy back the same asset to maintain your position in the asset (i.e. continue to hodl). The rate cryptocurrency is taxed at depends on how long you held the asset for and your annual income. If you held the asset for less than one year, your cryptocurrency gains will be taxed as a short-term capital gain at the same rate as your ordinary income, with a range of 10% - 37%.  If you held the asset for more than one year, it will be taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate, with a range of 0% - 20%.That’s right! While a bummer at the time, capital losses can be used to offset your gains and reduce the amount of taxes you could owe!  Savvy crypto investors are well aware of the tax implications of their trades throughout the year – and they use that to their advantage through a strategy called tax-loss harvesting.And, even if you don’t have capital gains to offset, tax-loss harvesting could still be beneficial as a capital loss deduction from your income.Step 1: To start, you’ll need a list of all your exchanges and transactions, including any 1099 forms received from exchanges.Step 2: Next, calculate your capital gains and losses by subtracting your cost-basis, or the price you bought the asset at, from the price you sold the asset at (Capital Gain or Loss = Selling Price - Cost-Basis).Step 3: Fill out your capital gains and losses on IRS Form 8949 for all events taxable as property.Step 4: Transfer totals from your IRS 8949 to Form 1040 Schedule D.Step 5: Fill out any remaining cryptocurrency income on Form 1040 (remember, this is from mining or staking, air drops, or getting paid in crypto).That’s it! At least for most people. If you are a higher volume trader, the process gets much more complex and it’s recommended that you use crypto tax automation software to calculate your gains and losses.Keep in mind that the more attention you pay to the tax implications of your crypto transactions year round, the easier you’ll have it come tax time. Not only that, but by making strategic trades in loss positions, you can reduce your tax liability – or even get a tax refund! Your future self will thank you later. ",2021-05-07
3665,"Exchange-traded fund (ETF) startup VanEck has filed for an ether-based ETF, public records show.The company, which currently has a proposed bitcoin ETF under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed an ether ETF on Friday that would allow retail and institutional traders to gain exposure to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap without requiring them to directly invest in it. VanEck intends to work with Cboe BZX Exchange on the offering. The same exchange is providing support for VanEck's proposed bitcoin ETF. The SEC has postponed any decision on VanEck's bitcoin ETF proposal to next month. In the past, the SEC has taken as much time as it legally can, about 240 days, to evaluate ETF proposals.

3666,"Marathon Digital Holdings’ (MARA) new mining pool has mined a bitcoin block that is “fully compliant with U.S. regulations,” meaning the company has started excluding transactions from entities it believes are sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury or have been involved in dark web activity.The Marathon OFAC pool, which was first announced in late March, “refrains from processing transactions from those listed on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN)” to stay “compliant with U.S. regulatory standards,” according to the company.Marathon said it is addressing a concern among “many large funds and corporations"" that have"" expressed interest in purchasing bitcoin” by marketing its mined bitcoin as OFAC-compliant. Marathon spokesman Jason Assad confirmed that the firm's first OFAC pool block censored some transactions, but didn’t specify which ones.“By excluding transactions between nefarious actors, we can provide investors and regulators with the peace of mind that the bitcoin we produce is ‘clean’, ethical and compliant with regulatory standards,” Marathon said in a statement.It should be noted that Marathon is mining “compliant” blocks of its own volition and that nothing in the current U.S. regulatory or legal code explicitly mandates that practice for miners. The company uses DMG’s Walletscore blockchain surveillance software to filter transactions, Assad told CoinDesk. The blacklist is “based on information provided by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Office of Foreign Assets Control, databases of OFAC restricted cryptocurrency addresses, as well as other sources including the dark web,” he said.Iran, which is included on OFAC’s sanctions list, is a hotbed of bitcoin adoption, partly in response to the pressures sanctions place on its citizens. (Notably but unrelated, Iran’s government just said that only bitcoin produced in Iran is legal to trade.)The practice of censoring transactions, sanctioned or otherwise (put another way, excluding them from blocks because of the sender’s presumed identity), is a subject of heated debate within the Bitcoin community. Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin mining to facilitate permissionless and censorship resistant transfers of value, but initiatives like Marathon's undermine that feature for no reason, critics say.""It is totally against the Bitcoin ethos as they are trying to make it a permissioned protocol instead of open for all,"" said Ben Carman, a Bitcoin Core and Suredbits developer.He also said Marathon's approach doesn't make sense. ""They are mining blocks that will not have the highest fee transactions, but (are) still on top of blocks with transactions they deem 'bad,' giving them more security,"" he said.Others also questioned the practicality of making a compliance claim.Indeed, despite Marathon’s surveillance, transactions from a Russian dark web market, Hydra, were still processed in the “clean” block.Further, shortly after Marathon blazoned the “clean” block on social media, bitcoiners from Iran and around the world began to send bitcoin to the address that received the Marathon “clean” block reward. The gesture was meant to display how easy it is to undermine Marathon’s initiative (and thus demonstrate how futile the chase is for “clean” coins).Miners speaking to CoinDesk from other pools declined to go on the record about Marathon and its compliance push, but the sentiment was generally negative. One miner laughed at the notion, while another called it a manufactured issue.Marathon began directing its hashrate, or computer processing power, to the OFAC pool on May 1 and mined its first block on May 5, Bitcoin block 682170. That block’s transaction fee reward, 0.05 BTC (worth less than $3,000 at the time) is substantially less than the fees collected in the blocks before or after it (both of which were 0.31 BTC or ~$17,800). Block 682172 included 0.48 BTC for nearly $28,000.BitMEX Research’s diagnosis notes that the block “contained 0.00330944 BTC less transaction fees than expected.” The block excluded a number of transactions that BitMEX’s own hypothetical template would have included, which “could indicate censorship,” the post said. Interestingly, it also included many transactions that BitMEX’s model excluded because their fees were too low to be considered a priority. That could indicate “out-of-band payments” for the fee, BitMEX says, which are under-the-table payments that are not included in the payer’s transaction.If Marathon is not receiving out-of-band fees, then so far its “compliant” blocks are netting significantly less in transaction fees. That portion of the block reward has become increasingly important for miner profits as bitcoin’s block subsidy has dwindled to its current rate of 6.25 BTC per block and demand for bitcoin has grown.Marathon’s block occurred only a minute after the one before, which could explain the block’s lower fee reward and transaction count. Marathon, however, still used it to censor transactions that, for other miners, would have gone through.",2021-05-07
3667,"Gustavo Filgueiras, a 25-year-old businessman in Brazil, began trading cryptocurrencies in 2019 after seeing an acquaintance’s crypto investment portfolio.“I like high-risk investments because they usually result in higher profits. As a consequence, crypto caught my eye,” Filgueiras said. Filgueiras knows 15 or so crypto investors in Brazil,  the majority of whom are day traders looking for quick gains. A few use crypto for savings or as a store of value, he said.Crypto is booming in Brazil, fueled by day traders like Filgueiras and his colleagues eager to take advantage of the ongoing bull market. Regulators, however, have yet to catch up. Save for a few tax requirements, Brazil’s crypto industry remains largely unregulated.Brazil's largest bitcoin exchange reported record trading volumes in the first quarter of 2021. Locals say they're interested in making a profit off the asset class. This is part of a larger regional trend: Other South American countries like Colombia and Argentina are seeing an explosion of interest in crypto as retail traders take advantage of crypto as an investment, remittance tool or store of value. Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, is struggling to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. It is one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, trailing the U.S. and India. The country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, is facing a criminal investigation for his controversial response to the pandemic. The economy is at risk of not recovering quickly from the recession that followed the first wave of the pandemic, while experts predict a spike in the inflation rate.  Against this backdrop of  political and economic uncertainty, institutional and retail traders alike are piling into crypto. Their interest was bolstered by the launch of two crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year.In the first quarter of 2021 alone, the country’s largest bitcoin exchange, Mercado Bitcoin, (with around 2.7 million users) traded almost $5 billion in crypto on its platform.This year’s volume so far is larger than the volume traded on the platform between 2013 and 2020, Mercado CEO Reinaldo Rabelo told CoinDesk. Through all of 2020 the platform traded just $1.2 billion.  Mercado Bitcoin was able to complete its first fundraising round this year, led by GP Investments and Parallax, and secured a $40 million investment to expand to other markets, Rabelo said. As part of this investment plan, Mercado agreed to buy Blockchain Academy, the largest crypto school in Brazil. “In the Brazilian market, the recent growth is due to the institutionalization of the subject, stimulated by the Coinbase [public listing], which led banks and even Brazil’s stock exchange B3, to make positive statements about investments in cryptocurrencies,” Rabelo said. Meanwhile, other big players in the region have moved in. In December, Mexico-based Bitso raised $62 million – a hefty portion of which was dedicated to expansion into Brazil. The firm launched operations in Brazil last week but did not answer specific questions about its volume in South America’s largest nation by press time. Argentinian crypto exchange Ripio began operations in Brazil in 2016. According to Juan Mendez, chief brand officer at Ripio, the platform had a couple of hundred users in Brazil at the beginning. Although Ripio saw impressive growth in Argentina in the last few years, adoption in Brazil was relatively slow, according to Mendez. But the numbers really started to pick up last year. “Since November 2020 we have seen an incremental growth in volume, and our user base is growing 10% month over month. That's a great sign that adoption is growing steadily in Brazil,” Mendez said. In January 2021, Ripio acquired Brazil’s second-largest crypto exchange, BitcoinTrade, to expand its presence in the country.In February, Brazilian asset manager Hashdex announced the launch of one of the world’s first crypto exchange-traded funds. The ETF created by Hashdex and Nasdaq, tracks the Nasdaq crypto index, and allows investors to access a diversified crypto portfolio in one transaction. The ETF began trading on the Sao Paulo-based stock exchange B3 in late April. In March, the Brazilian securities and exchange commission also approved a bitcoin ETF created by Latin American blockchain investment firm QR Capital. “We’re seeing lots of demand for bitcoin at what is the beginning of institutional adoption in Brazil. So we have a very strong expectation about this product,” Fernando Carvalho, CEO of QR Capital, told CoinDesk, adding the ETF will start trading on B3 in late May. According to Carvalho,  the 2020 bitcoin price run.was one reason for the increasing demand for bitcoin in Brazil through the pandemic. The demand spiked even more as the country’s central bank brought down its key interest rate to a historic low of 2% in August, and people began looking for alternative investments. Further, in 2020 Brazil’s inflation rate rose to over 5% for the first time in four years as the pandemic raged. In March, the central bank began raising interest rates to try to bring inflation back to its 3.75% target.  “In Brazil they had bad inflation numbers in 2020. This year didn’t start with very promising numbers either. Most of our staff, and also users in Brazil, chose crypto as a store of value and as an asset to invest in,” Mendez said.  Despite the growing use of cryptocurrencies in Brazil, the regulatory framework has been inconsistent. In 2014, Brazil’s tax authority, RFB, declared that virtual currencies will be subject to capital gains, but only if more than 35,000 Brazilian real (US$6,670) was involved in the settlement. In 2019, the RFB published guidance, requiring crypto traders to report transactions exceeding 30,000 real ($7,600 at the time) to the national treasury. Shortly before publishing new tax requirements, Brazil’s financial authorities also announced a fintech regulatory sandbox. According to Carvalho, 32 projects applied for approval for the testing environment and more than six of them are blockchain-based projects. The sandbox will select seven projects to test fintech services for a period of one year, he added. Crypto firms in the country are open to the proactive regulation of the space, Carvalho said. Businesses have been suffering from the lack of clarity in regulations, particularly because local banks are reluctant to work with crypto firms. In 2018, major local banks suddenly shut down accounts connected to crypto platforms in the country, leading to an investigation by Brazil’s antitrust authority. The banks denied they had worked together to halt services to crypto firms, claiming the accounts were closed because of violations of anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. The investigation was ongoing as of last year.Last year, Brazilian Senator Soraya Thronicke proposed a series of laws that could bring some legal clarity to Brazil’s unregulated crypto space, and could also hold scammers and fraudsters accountable. But there has been no update on the status of the proposed bill since then. “This is something that's moving really slow, in my opinion, it will probably not evolve at a very high speed because there's a lot of lack of knowledge about the technology,” Carvalho said. Filgueiras added that innovative initiatives, crypto or otherwise, tend to be viewed with skepticism in Brazil. “I believe we have a long road ahead of us, given that groundbreaking ventures still struggle a lot. I hope it changes soon, but I doubt it,” Filgueiras said.  ",2021-05-07
3668,"Turkish crypto exchanges will have to report purchases exceeding 10,000 Turkish lira (around $1,200) to financial authorities under upcoming anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, according to Turkish Finance and Treasury Minister Lütfi Elvan, who discussed the rules on CNN Turkey Thursday night.The Turkish government vowed to swiftly regulate the local crypto industry after two local cryptocurrency exchanges shut down operations overnight within days of each other in April, prompting an international manhunt for the CEO of one platform. Shortly after the incidents, Şahap Kavacıoğlu, the head of Turkey’s central bank, said that crypto regulations were coming soon, although he said an outright ban was unlikely.  On May 1, Turkey added crypto platforms to the list of firms covered by AML regulations. On Thursday night, Elvan said that he doesn't see the need to rush regulations and that they should be considered and implemented carefully. Elvan added that MASAK, Turkey’s financial crimes investigation board, has been given the authority to oversee compliance with the regulations. According to Tansel Kaya, managing partner at the Mindstone Blockchain Labs, the government needs to provide clarity and to do so soon. “For example, the latest order talks about crypto asset service providers? What are they? Unclear,"" Kaya said. “The government wants to access records. It's just how the mechanism is defined. Anything above 10,000 lira will be actively sent to the agency for monitoring financial crimes,” Kaya said. As recently as March, crypto was completely unregulated in the country, and the demand for bitcoin and other virtual currencies was on the rise, fueled by the recent pressure on the Turkish lira. But in mid-April, the government issued a ban on cryptocurrencies for payments that went into effect at the end of the month. Shortly afterward, local cryptocurrency exchanges Thodex and Vebitcoin went offline, prompting the government to speed up regulations.During his appearance on CNN Turkey, Alvan didn't specify when the new AML regulations would take effect.“All in all, we are going to have regulations soon,” Kaya said. ",2021-05-07

Gold, a traditional store-of-value asset, rose to $1,820 per ounce, the highest level since Feb. 16. The move came a day after the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond real yield fell to a three-month low of -0.88%, per data from the U.S. Treasury Department. ""Lower real rates boost gold which now trades below fair value,"" ByteTree CIO Charlie Morris tweeted Thursday.The collapse in real yields was in large part responsible for risk-taking across financial markets last year, as noted by MarketWatch. In addition, some institutions poured money into bitcoin amid fears over inflation. As such, some crypto market participants became more cautious in late February and early March 2021, after a brief spike in real yields to -0.57%. However, the latest bout of weakness in the inflation-adjusted 10-year yield is struggling so far to push bitcoin higher. Since mid-March, the yield has dropped by 30 basis points, marking a steady increase in inflation-adjusted loss for bond investors. Bitcoin registered a moderate decline of 1% during that time-frame, while gold has responded positively, rising from $1,700 to over $1,800.According to Bank of America, inflows into gold funds amounted to $1.6 billion in the week ended May 5, the largest in three months. In the crypto markets, investor focus has shifted from bitcoin to ether and Ethereum-related projects like decentralized finance and layer 2 scaling. That could be the reason for bitcoin's lackluster performance of late. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has chalked up more than 60% gains in just the past 12 days. That said, a continued rally in gold may revive spirits in the bitcoin market, as the precious metal led the cryptocurrency higher last year. Gold picked up a strong bid last June and surged to new record highs above $2,000 in August. Bitcoin followed suit in the final quarter, charting a near 90-degree rise to new record highs above $20,000.History may well repeat itself this time because bitcoin funds are again becoming popular. A report earlier this week from digital-asset manager CoinShares showed bitcoin funds and investment products drew $442 million last week, having leaked a record $21 million in the preceding week. While the declining negative real yield is currently painting a bullish picture for bitcoin and gold, some analysts are of the opinion that good times may not last long. Also read: Bitcoin Options Traders Leaning Bearish Despite Price Recovery""The bad news is global tapering has begun,"" analysts at Bank of America said, adding that the process could pick up the pace in the third quarter, according to ForexLive.

The survey was included in the Fed's latest semiannual report on financial stability, published Thursday. Notably, the Fed's own staffers made no mention of cryptocurrencies in their analysis of the risks.

3678,"The tokens of the Ethereum blockchain's competitors are making huge gains Thursday, while ether set a new price record above $3,600. Bitcoin has less than 10% of gold’s market capitalization but could continue to differentiate itself from the yellow metal and grow its piece of the total market-cap pie.Big-time gainers Thursday included tokens associated with blockchain projects that aim to replicate some of the key attributes of Ethereum, mainly programmability.In the past month, ethereum classic (ETC) has gained over 1,250%, while cardano (ADA) has jumped 238% and eos (EOS) is up 42%, according to Kraken spot data provided by charting software TradingView. The gains come as the giant Dutch bank ING used a recent report to throw some support behind the notion of programmable money used for decentralized finance, or DeFi. “The recent bull run of ETH has shed some light on competing projects to the Ethereum value proposition, which can be bundled into a category that we can call a ‘sector,” said Elie Le Rest, partner at trading firm ExoAlpha. “The crypto market tends to work on comparable principles, meaning that if a coin of a ‘sector’ has been doing great, such as ETH in the ‘layer 1 sector,’ then other coins of this same sector may follow a similar trend.”Layer 1 refers to blockchains that can serve as the foundation for various programming languages to create applications, known as smart contracts, that perform financial functions. Ethereum is a layer 1 smart-contract blockchain; ETC, ADA, and EOS are similar. A Wall Street Journal article published Thursday highlights that retail investors are searching for value coins. Ethereum classic may no longer fit that bill, currently priced around $130, according to CoinDesk 20 data, but cardano priced at around $1.63 and eos at a little over $12 certainly do. “Interest has flowed out of bitcoin and into [altcoins] for the time being. People are looking further out the risk spectrum for returns,” noted Ciaran Neilan, an executive at crypto market maker GSR.Bitcoin’s dominance, its share of the greater cryptocurrency market cap, is one sign of a loss of interest for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency. As of press time, BTC dominance, according to chart provider TradingView, was at around 45%, a low not seen since July 2018. During the last bull market, at the start of 2018, bitcoin’s dominance dumped to an all-time low of 35% as investors redeployed their bitcoin gains into alternative cryptocurrencies. Early this year, bitcoin dominance went as high as 72%. GSR’s Neilan said that dominance percentage will likely return. “It will end how it usually does,"" Neilan said. ""BTC consolidates, then takes back the headlines.”Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, hit a fresh high Thursday of $3,607 at around 17:30 UTC (12:30 p.m. ET), according to CoinDesk 20 data.

3679,"The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a central bank-owned retail payments system, has deferred the issue of whether to allow customers to make and receive payments from cryptocurrency trading to commercial banks, according to the Economic Times.Some bankers apparently had asked the agency to block crypto transactions on its network, the paper reported. Instead, the agency told banks they should consult their legal and compliance departments on whether they should block transactions on their own systems. “The banks had approached NPCI for restricting direct UPI transactions,” the Economic Times wrote, citing an industry official. “However, the committee has put the onus on banks.”The development represents the latest chapter in the ongoing saga of whether the Indian government might crack down on cryptocurrencies, even as trading volumes in digital assets have exploded over the past 12 months. In March 2020, the Supreme Court of India set aside the Reserve Bank of India's banking ban on cryptocurrency trading. Since early this year, the Indian government has been mulling a ban on private cryptocurrencies.NPCI's decision to put the onus on the banks comes at a time when few lenders are blocking cryptocurrency deals.

3681,"Grave pronouncements are circulating amid the recent surge in interest in dogecoin. As the meme-currency rallies, hitting a recent high above 70 cents, some people see the retail-led, celebrity-endorsed in-joke as a potential harbinger for greater government involvement in crypto as a whole. The joke has gotten serious.Dogecoin is the best-performing digital asset over the past year. Worth less than 1 cent at the start of 2020, dogecoin has become one of the most valuable crypto networks. It has a market cap of $77 billion, making it worth more than Lloyds Banking Group, as Galaxy Digital noted in a recent Dogecoin report. If U.S. investors put all three of their pandemic relief stimulus checks in DOGE, as they came in, they’d be sitting pretty on nearly half a million dollars.“I don't think people realize yet how badly this Dogecoin thing is going to end. Going to be a disaster of epic proportions and a lot of people that don't know any better are going to get hurt,” Jeff Vandroux, accountant developer of the KeyKeeper Bitcoin IRA, said on Twitter. “It's also going to offer up on a silver platter an excuse for more [government] monitoring.”There are technical concerns worth taking seriously about dogecoin. Although fairly distributed with about 2,000 active nodes, less than a quarter are fully synced (or broadcasting the most up-to-date history of the blockchain). Some active nodes are missing more than half the blockchain’s transaction history.Further, it can be incredibly hard to spin up a DOGE node. Galaxy, a well-capitalized digital merchant bank that is planning a U.S. listing, had trouble running Dogecoin core. The network’s one minute block times mean most nodes experience latency, Galaxy found. This makes the network less secure and harder to transact on.That said, the most apocalyptic fears are overblown. Although vulnerable to 51% attacks, the Dogecoin network is relatively secure. A fork-of-a-fork-of-a-fork-of-Litecoin, Dogecoin is also merge-mined with its forbear, meaning it shares network security with Charlie Lee’s brainchild. And while there hasn’t been active Dogecoin development since 2017, its lead maintainer, Ross Nicoll, is committed to keeping the “currency operational.”But dogecoin is more of a social phenomenon than a technical one. Launched as a parody of bitcoin and a multitude of copycats, DOGE is paraded as being the “people’s crypto.” That’s what Mark Cuban says as he enables the masses to buy overpriced Mavs merch with DOGE.In this sense, dogecoin has very real associations with the day-traders’ populist revolt of GameStop. Bloq Chairman Matthew Roszak said yesterday on CoinDesk TV that dogecoin is “a primitive” for what could happen when a band of “like-minded” people realize their collective power.GameStop made some sundry folk very rich, tanked a hedge fund and enriched several of its Wall Street peers. It also led to congressional hearings on obscure financial mechanisms like “payment for order flow” and t+2 settlement. Changes to both are likely, for better or worse.Vandroux, the CPA, isn’t alone in thinking what’s happening with dogecoin could end badly. Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal thinks widespread losses could increase the heat on the entire cryptocurrency industry. Others have raised similar concerns.It’s not out of the question that greater market surveillance or “consumer protections” may result from this irrational exuberance.Despite its technical weaknesses, popular brokerages Robinhood and WeBull are letting people day-trade the coin, while crypto natives like Gemini recently listed it, saying it’s “no joke.” Should they be howled out of town for making money on trading fees? Should they be held responsible for coming government interference? Who is going to take dogecoin out back to make like Old Yeller for the sake of the industry?Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Wall Street Journal recently: “I frankly don't think we have the framework in the United States” to deal with a host of money laundering, terrorist financing and consumer risk protection that crypto raises. Surveillance is coming one way or another. Man, it's already here.Is DOGE being made into a scapegoat?",2021-05-06

3684,"A mere mention on TV would give dogecoin (DOGE) huge mainstream exposure. But April’s ""Dogeday"" flop suggests the ""Elon effect"" may be priced in.Only in the looking-glass world of 2021 could a late-night comedy show have the potential to move markets. Dogecoin fans are hoping for another price surge this weekend when Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla and SpaceX, hosts the U.S. television program “Saturday Night Live."" Numerous fans have asked the billionaire entrepreneur to mention the meme-inspired cryptocurrency in one of his sketches. In a tweet last week, the billionaire Tesla CEO strongly hinted he would do so: “The Dogefather SNL May 8”. The episode is scheduled to air at 11:30 p.m. Eastern time Saturday, or 03:30 UTC Sunday, on the NBC television network.Merely mentioning the dog-themed cryptocurrency on the air would give the digital asset significant exposure to a mainstream audience. So far, the 46th season of ""SNL"" has ranked as the number 1 U.S. comedy show in terms of viewers, with 4.1% of the American population aged 18-49 tuning in. So there’ll likely be plenty of people watching Musk and musical guest Miley Cyrus who haven’t come across dogecoin before (unless they caught Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban promoting the currency on Ellen Degeneres’ daytime talk show recently).Musk’s tweet set in motion a dogecoin rally that has sent prices skyrocketing 106% to a new all-time high of $0.69. New exchange listings on eToro and Gemini during the week have helped sustain the rally and allowed dogecoin to overtake XRP as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.The question now is, will Musk’s TV appearance deliver on expectations and help drive dogecoin to new heights, or will the social media-driven hype fall flat as it did during last month’s anti-climatic “Dogeday”?Musk’s involvement with dogecoin dates back to September 2018, when he publicly enlisted the help of dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer to stop scammers spamming his Twitter posts.Seven months later, Musk won an April Fool's Day poll to become the project's new “CEO” and responded with his first-ever dogecoin-related tweet, “Doge might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.” And so the Musk-dogecoin love affair began.Since then, the Tesla CEO has tweeted numerous references and memes related to dogecoin and consistently sent prices soaring to higher levels. But it’s not just doge prices that are susceptible to the “Elon effect.” Two spikes in Google searches for “dogecoin” this year coincided with Musk mentioning the cryptocurrency on his social media feed. The first was in January during the Wallstreetbets stock-trading frenzy which, perhaps inevitably, spilled over to the Shiba Inu-themed cryptocurrency and got supercharged by Musk tweeting an image of a dog on the cover of “Dogue” magazine. The second took place in April right around the time Musk published a post stating “SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon.”Despite its popularity, soaring price and celebrity endorsements, there are a number of risks associated with buying and holding the parody cryptocurrency compared to holding something like bitcoin (BTC):Yet, in spite of these flaws and the fact that dogecoin is at its heart a joke cryptocurrency, it continues to outpace almost every other digital asset in the market and garner worldwide attention. So will dogecoin go to the moon? Well, one could argue it’s already there.",2021-05-06

3688,"Prices for ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, have already quadrupled this year. Now, some options traders are betting prices could double again – by the end of next month.   Market data reveals growing demand for ether's deep out-of-the-money (OTM) call options – bullish bets with strike prices well above the spot market price of the underlying asset. Ether has rallied from $2,000 to record highs over $3,500 in the past 10 days. On Tuesday, a single high-net-worth trader or a group of traders bought 9,000 contracts of the $8,000 call expiring June 25. These block trades crossed the tape via the institution-focused, over-the-counter desk Paradigm and were booked on Deribit, the leading exchange for cryptocurrency options. Theoretically, buyers of the calls are expecting the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap to rise above $8,000 by the end of June. However, if ether continues its steep bull run for few more weeks, the price of the $8,000 call would surge, simply because the trade would be more likely to pay off. At that point, traders could sell the options in the market for a quick profit. Whatever transpires, according to analysts, the surge in demand now for the $8,000 call implies bullish price expectations potentially linked to the network upgrade known as EIP 1559 that would reduce the pace of the net issuance of ether.  ""Investors look to be betting on continued bullish momentum in anticipation of a big drop in ether's issuance after the EIP 1559 upgrade,"" according to Laevitas, a Swiss data analytics firm for cryptocurrency markets. Call options, or bullish bets, with strikes ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 listed on Deribit have become popular in recent weeks. Also read: Amid New Price Highs, Ether Flips Bitcoin on Options VolumeThat said, the risks are steep. With the strike price so far away, the options could easily expire worthless, and the buyers would forfeit the premiums they paid for the contracts.Hence, buying these deeply out-of-the-money call options is often considered analogous to buying lottery tickets. ",2021-05-06
3689,"In a reminder that easy money prevails, cryptocurrencies rallied on Wednesday with bitcoin (BTC) up about 5% over the last 24-hours. It was trading at $57,133 at the time of writing. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, bounced back from Tuesday's sell-off, pushing toward the all-time high of around $3,500. News that Fidelity National has teamed up with NYDIG, a crypto custody firm, to allow U.S. banks to offer customers the ability to buy, sell and hold bitcoin contributed to bullish trading activity on Wednesday. “Bitcoin could see continued momentum back above $60,000 just on the Fidelity news,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, a foreign exchange broker, wrote, describing the news as a “game-changer.”Additionally, news that Galaxy Digital, a crypto-focused financial services firm, agreed to buy BitGo, the U.S. regulated crypto custody specialist, was another positive development for cryptocurrencies. But the big story of the day was a 53% jump over the past 24 hours in price for ethereum classic (ETC), born of a contentious split a few years ago from the dominant Ethereum blockchain.Cryptocurrency markets are witnessing such a bull frenzy that some also-ran tokens like ethereum classic that were left behind during last year’s rallies in bitcoin and ether are getting a fresh look from speculative traders and surging to previously unthinkable levels. The Ethereum Classic blockchain split from better-known Ethereum as part of a contentious “hard fork” in 2017. Last year, as enthusiasm mounted over the potential growth of decentralized finance, or DeFi, prices for ether, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, quadrupled. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, doubled, while Ethereum Classic’s token, ETC, gained just 26%. Now, in 2021, cryptocurrency prices are surging across the board: The doggie-themed joke token dogecoin (DOGE) has increased a laughable-if-it-weren’t-true 117-fold. And ETC is joining the hunt, jumping 13-fold in digital-asset markets this year to a value of roughly $13 billion. ETC hit a record high of $87 early Wednesday and was changing hands over $100 at press time, representing a 59% gain on a 24-hour basis, according to the data provider Messari.That’s despite few major cryptocurrency investors or analysts regularly mentioning the network as one of several potential “Ethereum killers” – upstart blockchains like Cardano, Polkadot, Solana and Binance Smart Chain that might provide alternatives to Ethereum for DeFi applications.“It appears to be dominated by ‘cheaper’ ethereum play and retail flow that has pushed DOGE to sky-high levels,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk.Read More: Also-Ran Ethereum Classic Catches Up Amid Crypto Market Frenzy, Hits RecordBitcoin was in full recovery mode Wednesday as traders brushed off concerns about rising U.S. interest rates, which had rattled cryptocurrency markets a day earlier. The rebound came as U.S. stocks gained on strong economic data and after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen backtracked on her warning about the eventual end of loose monetary policy.  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, often trades in sync with traditional markets because it's increasingly viewed by big institutional investors as a hedge against future inflation.  “Yellen had to clarify her comments and basically retracted everything,” Moya wrote in an email.Some analysts described Yellen’s comments as a mere side note in financial media.“Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is now in charge and he remains dovish, ready to support the economy,” wrote Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics. “The party will continue for as long as the fundamentals stay the same.”Bitcoin is approaching initial resistance at around $58,000, a level where traders have taken profits during the past few months. The cryptocurrency is recovering from the mid-April sell-off, although technical analysts remain cautious. “Short-term overbought conditions have returned below resistance of $62,000-$65,000, which presents a near-term hurdle,” Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies wrote in an email. “Any move below $50K in BTC will lead to sharp increase in market volatility and all crypto assets including BTC and ETH should move lower. Traders would keenly watch $60K level as a major resistance in case of any bull trap rally,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta, a crypto derivatives exchange, wrote in an email.In the bitcoin futures market, traders continue to deleverage after the April 14 sell-off. In the past few days, the cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in the cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets, declined to just above 0% – a level that typically precedes price recoveries.“One of the key explanations behind the declining funding rates could be the ongoing altseason, attracting the risk seekers to move onto other coins in the spot market,” Arcane Research wrote in a report published Tuesday. “With less leverage, fewer positions will risk becoming liquidated, setting the stage for less dramatic price movements.”In traditional markets, equities recovered after Tuesday’s slump with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ending Wednesday in the green. Over the past eight months, bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 has declined, which could point to the cryptocurrency’s diversification benefits. Bitcoin has largely decoupled from traditional equities since the March 2020 correction across risk assets. And since then, unprecedented stimulus has encouraged a reach for yield beyond traditional assets.Ether is up about 2.6% in the past 24-hours, compared with a roughly 5% gain in BTC. Ether broke a 10-day winning streak on Tuesday and has since stabilized, benefitting from the broader crypto recovery. “Ether has been skyrocketing and today’s weakness is just modest profit-taking,” Oanda's Moya wrote.The amount of ether held on exchanges has fallen to a 2.5-year low, suggesting few traders are queuing up to take profits and institutions are warming up to the crypto asset, according to Pete Humiston, manager of Kraken Intelligence. Market participants have ""locked up more than 4 million ETH – 600K on Kraken’s on-chain staking service alone,” Humiston wrote. “The stars are aligning for another significant leg up for the ETH price.”Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green on Wednesday.

3690,"Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University are warning that sharp price swings and liquidations could disproportionately impact smaller traders as the market for crypto derivatives booms.A recent study by the Pittsburgh-based Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab found trading volume in cryptocurrency derivatives exceeds that of the underlying spot markets.“Sophisticated actors are taking from amateur investors,"" Kyle Soska, a researcher at the lab who co-authored the report, said in an interview. ""Wealth centralization is taking place and there are a few big players.” Liquidation events occur when traders cannot fulfill margin requirements for holding crypto derivative positions and often exacerbate price moves. In April, bitcoin futures had a record $10 billion worth of liquidations in one day after data showed leveraged traders were excessively skewed bullish. The liquidation coincided with a near 15% drop in BTC from an all-time high of around $65,000.“When markets are trending up everybody makes money, but during a wipeout a few big actors take everything and the little guys are taken out,” Soska said.Traders who take on smaller contract sizes are typically more long-biased, or betting on bullish price movements, according to the study. The short side of the trade typically consists of hedgers who own spot market bitcoin or cryptocurrency miners who want to manage revenue volatility by locking in prices for a specific delivery date in the future. That means traders who have short positions in the derivatives market are more likely to be price-neutral in terms of their overall positions, making the BTC futures market more of a speculative net-long play, according to Soska.“This is why there is a distinct asymmetry with long positions that are more leveraged with small position sizes,” Soska said. The researchers analyzed trading activity on BitMEX, a derivatives exchange launched in 2014 that trades over $3 billion worth of volume per day on average. The exchange allows users to go long or short bitcoin with leverage of up to 100 times, often shorthanded as ""100x,"" according to the report.“We focused on BitMEX because [it was] the only player back in 2014 and remained relevant for a long period of time,” said Soska. In October, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged BitMEX with executing futures transactions on an unregistered board, as well as other counts, “in an attempt to evade U.S. regulations,” according to the CFTC legal filing.When contacted by CoinDesk for comment, a spokesperson for 100x Group, the holding structure for BitMEX, pointed to a statement the exchange had provided to the researchers in advance of publication, in which exchange executives took issue with some parts of the draft.  ""The paper contains various inaccurate and/or misleading statements that do not properly reflect the platform's structure and operations,"" according to that November statement, which was included in the final report. In an email, the spokesperson wrote that while ""higher leverage is available, we've historically seen the majority of traders opt to use lower leverage, with the notional weighted average leverage being under 10x."" The CyLab report suggests that crypto derivatives, through excessive leverage and cascading liquidations, are supportive of rapid price jumps that have been commonplace in bitcoin. “This raises concerns about the impact that derivatives have on BitMEX’s customers and on the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole,” the researchers wrote.Crichton said the researchers were led to the topic, in part, because of the growing stature of cryptocurrency markets in global finance.  In 2019, Carnegie Mellon University announced a partnership with Ripple, a global payment network using blockchain technology, to fund academic research on cryptocurrencies. CyLab also published a companion website with real-time analytics of BitMEX data and said it encourages collaboration across the crypto research community. “Crypto has gained a lot more attraction in the academic world in terms of being a more legitimized thing,” Soska said.CORRECTION (May 5, 21:19 UTC): This article has been corrected to show that the lead author of the study was Kyle Soska.

Dogecoin also hit a new lifetime high of $0.69 early today. However, at press time, the joke cryptocurrency was up just 14%, while ETC was up 43%, as per CoinDesk 20 data.That's despite few major cryptocurrency investors or analysts regularly mentioning the network as one of several potential ""Ethereum killers"" – upstart blockchains like Cardano, Polkadot, Solana and Binance Smart Chain that might provide alternatives to Ethereum for DeFi applications.""It appears to be dominated by 'cheaper' ethereum play and retail flow that has pushed DOGE to sky-high levels,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk.  The ethereum classic token, now ranked 16th as per market value, has rallied by 128% in the first five days of May. Such a performance outruns even dogecoin, which has climbed 90% during the period and rose to a new record early Wednesday, at the meme-y price level of 69 cents. Notably, ethereum classic may be getting an uplift from traders looking for an antidote against inflationary pressures as coronavirus-related restrictions lift – a theme that has drawn many big institutional investors to bitcoin.   According to Messari, pursuant to the Ethereum Classic blockchain's underlying coding, the ultimate supply of ETC will be capped at a maximum of 210.7 million tokens, and the pace of fresh supply gets reduced every time 5 million additional data blocks are added to the blockchain. So the renewed interest in ETC could represent another side effect of the Federal Reserve's trillions of dollars of money printing since March 2020. “You are seeing things in the capital markets that are a bit frothy, that’s a fact,” Powell said last week during a virtual press conference. “I won’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but also it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy.”The wall of money from big institutional investors as well as retail traders looking for fast returns began flowing into crypto markets via bitcoin in October 2020. As a result, the top cryptocurrency has chalked up a sixfold rally in the past seven months, rising from $10,000 to record highs above $64,800. However, prices have steadied in the range of $50,000 to $60,000 over the past two weeks.Also read: Dogecoin Price Finally Tops 69c, Flips XRP to Become Top-4 CryptoLately, the buzz has turned to ether, which is now regularly pushing to new all-time highs.

The National Bank is expecting the prospective partners from the private sector to make suggestions on keeping costs low, ease of use and near-instant settlement, the announcement said. The future solution should also allow for smart contracts and automatic payments, ""for example automatic tax accounting and tax collection for simple transactions.""

The Federal Reserve cut rates to a record low of 0.25% a year ago and has been buying bonds worth $120 billion every month to contain the coronavirus pandemic's impact on markets and the economy.Bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the Fed's massive inflation-boosting stimulus measures launched in March 2020. The cryptocurrency has charted a six-fold rally over the past 12 months.While the Fed recently reiterated its commitment to keep the liquidity tap open for a prolonged period, some experts fear the U.S. central bank would ditch its pro-easing bias and turn hawkish later this year. ""We think the market is starting to price a hawkish change in stance into the June and all-important September meeting[s] later,"" QCP Capital said in a market update on its Telegram channel.""We expect Fed speakers this week will now set the stage for this shift in domestic stance and outlook, although the worsening [COVID-19] situation will likely buy them some time,"" the firm added.The U.S. dollar is starting to show signs of life amid a growing debate over whether Biden's massive spending, coupled with a vaccine-led economic recovery, would force the Fed to scale back stimulus earlier than expected.The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, rose to a 2.5-week high of 91.44 earlier today, extending its recovery from the two-month low of 90.42 reached on April 29, according to data and chart provider TradingView.Also read: Bitcoin in Retreat; Taproot Apparently Not Winning Sufficient Miner SupportA continued rally in the U.S. dollar could yield deeper losses for bitcoin.

Earlier, ether and  dogecoin touched new all-time high prices.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a catalyst for the midday sell-off after she warned that interest rates may need to rise. Some traders apparently sold on concerns the cheap money era might not last forever.Ether was trading around $3,369 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), up 3.4% over the prior 24 hours after falling to as low as $3,168 a few hours earlier. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had hit a record high earlier on Tuesday, surging to $3,530 around 14:30 UTC (9:30 a.m. ET). That is over $200 more than the previous record, set Monday, of $3,300. ETH is above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians. There seems to be some fascination among ether traders with the $3,000 level, noted Alessandro Andreotti, a trader in the over-the-counter crypto market.  “ETH has taken the spotlight for shattering the $3,000 barrier,” he said.In addition to record high prices, ether’s volumes are also hitting records. In fact, according to data from CoinDesk Research, ether’s exchange volume was higher than that of bitcoin to start the week. On Monday, spot exchange volume for ether tallied $61 billion, with the spot BTC market changing hands at $52 billion.Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto market maker GSR, says ether and bitcoin are now behaving as very separate assets, which normally isn’t the case. ""There’s a disconnect between BTC and ETH,” Rosenblum told CoinDesk. This disconnect could lead to ether heading up further, according to Nick Spanos, co-founder of decentralized finance startup Zap Protocol. “From the pace ETH has gathered in recent days, its continued growth path is certain, and levels above $5,000"" represent the new target, Spanos said. Spanos also noted that ether’s dominance, or its share of the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, is now approaching 18%. That's the highest it has been since 2018 at the end of the previous big cryptocurrency bull run.“The current all-time high over $3,500 has reignited the ambitious sentiment that ethereum may eventually flip bitcoin by market capitalization in the near future,” noted Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of crypto exchange CEX.IO. Read More: Ether Price, on Cusp of Record 10-Day Winning Streak, Tops $3,500Dogecoin hit an all-time high Tuesday, breaking over $0.61 around 15:00 UTC (10:15 a.m. ET).

BTC is below the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians. “So far, BTC has stayed relatively stable while [altcoins] have continued to climb,” said trader Alessandro Andreotti. While it does feel as if bitcoin’s day-to-day price changes have been stable, its 60-day volatility is moving up, rising from a recent low of 45% April 15. It is currently at over 64% as of Monday’s closing data. By comparison, the S&P 500’s 30-day volatility stands at a little over 10%, according to CoinDesk Research.Bitcoin’s fall Tuesday may have been exacerbated by the traditional markets. While Asia and Europe were mixed for the day, U.S. stocks have slipped on the possibility of higher interest rates, which Treasury Secretary Yellen mentioned on Tuesday. The fall in stocks was followed by a slip in many crypto assets. “The crypto market appears to be entering a cyclical phase away from beta and into stock-picking mode,” noted Vishal Shah, founder of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Alpha5, referring to the move away from quant trading.Read More: Bitcoin Stabilizes After Pullback; Faces Resistance at $58KDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the red on Tuesday.

3698,"Ether (ETH) is on a tear (more than $3,200 at the time of writing) and it’s not hard to see why. Last month, ConsenSys economist (and CoinDesk columnist) Lex Sokolin said recent price action in ETH is the result of years of building. There are more Ethereum-based products than ever, more users and more ways for people to deploy their capital, earn yield and have fun.“The price action that people are excited about – that's the result of custodians and financial infrastructure firms and wallets put into place over the past several years,” he said on CoinDesk TV.Sokolin is pointing to a cycle of legitimacy where the driving ideas and promises of Ethereum, the so-called “world computer,” are actually being encoded. These tools help justify the price of ETH in a similar way traditional investors value a company stock by examining its balance sheet.But there’s another factor at play in Sokolin’s reading: the excitement he mentioned in the first half of that quote. People are generally “excited” by the price of ether, not just the network itself. Price drives interest, which reflexively drives higher prices.See also: Michael Casey – Dogecoin and the New Meaning of MoneyWhile meme-driven finance may seem new – like a peculiar offspring of decades of loose monetary policy, increasing internet usage and being cooped inside during a global pandemic – many see this economic activity as rooted in some of the most primitive human behavior.In seeking to explain the “ponzinomics” of token systems, several market analysts – like Tony Sheng and Deribit’s Matti – have taken up the theories of mimetics and reflexivity rooted in the work of 20th century philosopher Rene Girard.Memetic analysis seems anything but scientific, but for Girard it’s the secret to understanding most human behaviors and cultural formation. Matti gives a crash course definition of Girard’s main idea: “A human [is] a lifelong child that desires the toy someone else has just picked up.” In other words, people often don’t know what they want until they see what someone else has.Girard’s most famous student, Peter Thiel, was thinking of mimetic theory when investing in Facebook. Social networks are playgrounds where human desires, envies and competitions are on full display.Applying mimetic theory to crypto, Deribit’s Matti argues that a cryptocurrency’s price is a meme. It may be a way to judge actual network activity but it’s also a signal of what other people find desirable.“Price makes memes concrete,” coder and writer Rachel-Rose O’Leary said in a direct message. “In crypto we have our own words for this: FUD and FOMO. In a cyclical, almost seasonal pattern, FUD gives way to FOMO – fear gives way to mimetic desire.”Crypto, more than most economic activity, is future oriented. While the code may be deployed today, the real story is the promise of disruption tomorrow, or what O’Leary calls an “overall preference for narrative.”See also: Emily Parker – Why We Should Take Dogecoin SeriouslyPeople buy into the idea that Ethereum is the world computer or that bitcoin is a global reserve currency. Not today, but tomorrow. And ultimately, as Matti says, it is the aggregate of active observers that ""decides what reflexive assets will become.""Price gives people a reason to believe, a story to invest in and an object to desire – as long as it’s going up. But reflexivity works in the opposite direction, too.",2021-05-04

Prices for most of the biggest digital assets appeared to turn down right around the time U.S. stock markets opened in the red.

If the gains are held through the daily close (23:59 UTC), ether would cement a 10-day winning trend, the longest since early January 2018, according to Coinbase data.Ether (ETH), which is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has nearly quintupled this year, in a rally fueled by speculation over the future of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, as well as other use cases like non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. There's also mounting evidence of robust growth in transaction volumes and other network metrics, as documented in a May 3 tweet by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. In 2021, the cryptocurrency has outshone the larger bitcoin (BTC), which has doubled so far this year. Ether's market value has now topped $400 billion, but it's still well behind the $1.04 trillion for bitcoin. The rising popularity of ether futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) shows institutions are seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency via derivatives markets.Open interest in the CME futures, or the amount of outstanding positions, rose to a record high of $473 million on Monday, marking a 23-fold increase since the first-day tally of $20 million, per data provider Skew. Ether futures went live on the CME on Feb. 8.On Monday, some $581 million of ether futures contracts changed hands on the CME, up 17-fold since the debut.The CME data demonstrates the increasing influence of institutional money in the market, according to analysts at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx.""Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures are one of the primary ways that institutional investors can get exposure to crypto,"" Coin Metrics' weekly newsletter published on Tuesday said.

3702,"Ether's (ETH) record price rally has triggered a flurry of activity in the options market, driving the cryptocurrency to surpass bitcoin (BTC) in terms of trading volumes for the first time. The ""flippening,"" along with ether's strong price performance in recent weeks, is a further sign of market focus temporarily shifting away from bitcoin, the top crypto asset by market value.On Monday, four larger exchanges offering ETH options – Deribit, OKEx, Huobi, and bit.com – registered a combined trading volume high of $1.32 billion, surpassing bitcoin's tally for the first time on record. Bitcoin's options market traded contracts worth $879 million on the same day, according to data source Skew. Ether's options volume soared as prices for the native token of the Ethereum blockchain rose toward a new lifetime high above $3,400 reached Tuesday. While ether has rallied by over 60% in the past four weeks, bitcoin has dropped by 3%, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Options are derivatives contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to purchase, and the put represents the right to sell. Ether options volume has picked up materially since mid-April, with dominant exchange Deribit contributing over 80% of the total activity. Ether options open interest, or the number of contracts traded but not settled with offsetting positions, has risen sharply to new record highs above $5 billion, per Skew. Meanwhile, open interest in bitcoin's options market has been trending lower in recent weeks, as seen below. A similar divergence is seen in the activity in futures tied to the two top cryptocurrencies. The data represents a shift in investor focus from bitcoin to ether, with Ethereum seeing solid organic growth this year, as recently tweeted by DTC Capital's Spencer Noon. A report published by digital-asset manager CoinShares on April 26 showed that ether funds and investment products saw an inflow of $34 million in the third week of April, while bitcoin funds lost $21 million.""New investor money has been flowing into digital assets since the 3rd quarter of last year, but the investor goals are changing,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, noted in a market recap published on Monday. ""And in the last few months, the investor interest has narrowed even further to 'can I specifically diversify away from Bitcoin into Ethereum and other digital assets?'""Analysts foresee a continued bull run in ether, with some betting on a rally to $10,000. Therefore, more traders and investors could join ether's derivatives market in a bid to hedge their spot market exposure, or to take plain bullish or bearish bets. At press time, ether's options market is decisively bullish on the cryptocurrency with one, three and six-month put-call skews trading well below zero – a sign of calls (bullish bets) drawing higher than demand than puts. Also read: Now's the Time to Bet on Volatility in Bitcoin and Ether Markets: Options Experts ",2021-05-04

The new listing opens dogecoin to some 20 million users spread across the globe. Then Tuesday morning Gemini announced it too will support the meme-based crypto, adding fuel to DOGE's upward trajectory.Additional buying pressure may have stemmed from pro baseball team Oakland Athletics' decision to sell tickets for dogecoin. In an announcement on Monday, the Major League baseball team said it was selling two-seat pods for 100 DOGE ($48.80 at the time of writing) for its three-match series against the Toronto Blue Jays.The quick recovery from a 40% April 23 flash crash shows a strong ""buy the dip"" mentality in the market.

With the staggering rally, DOGE's market capitalization has surged to over $59 billion, according to Messari, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the world. Daily miner revenues recently rose to new record highs above $3 million. The project, which started as a joke in 2013, has gained mainstream acceptance this year with the likes of NBA team Dallas Mavericks, medical supplier CovCare and several others adding support for dogecoin as a payments alternative.

BNB breaks out on DeFi, going past $100 billion in market capitalization Monday.Ether was trading around $3,290 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), gaining more than 10% over the prior 24 hours. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is the crypto story for Monday because the asset hit a fresh record high of $3,300 around 18:15 UTC (2:15 p.m. ET), according to CoinGecko. “Ether has accelerated to new highs, reaching the targeted level of ~$3,000 from its April breakout far sooner than indicated,” noted technical analyst Katie Stockton, in Fairlead Strategies' Monday market update. “It is not wise to fight momentum, so we are reassuming a bullish near-term bias, somewhat reluctantly.”Momentum, in the form of ether spot exchange volume, is clearly high. Ether volume tallied $35 billion Sunday, with bitcoin just a bit higher at $39 billion. Together, the two assets changed over $74 billion in value Sunday – and that’s on a weekend day. Traders will be eyeing volume for the rest of the business week to see where the price settles, particularly with ether continually hitting fresh levels on the spot market. Meanwhile, over $20 billion in locked value inside decentralized finance, or DeFi, has been gained in the last month, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse. The value of ether, combined with traders looking for yield that exists for parking crypto in DeFi, is a fundamentally bullish sign for the Ethereum network overall. “ETH has been powering for the past two years on the booming DeFi industry with a total value locked above $70 billion,” noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quantitative trading fund ExoAlpha. Le Rest also mentioned to CoinDesk the ambitious ecosystem upgrade Ethereum 2.0 as part of the catalyst for traders to punch buy on ETH. “Despite the high fees experienced by the Ethereum network, the market is starting to reflect the anticipated growth of ETH 2.0 into the price of ETH.”The ether futures market is hitting brand-new levels not seen before, pushing open interest up to $8.8 billion and topping the previous record of $8.4 billion reached April 15, according to analytics provider Skew.“I bet the launch of ETH futures has increased the comfort level of the massive asset managers that have sent U.S. stock market capitalization north of 200% of GDP and global bond yields negative,” said George Clayton, managing partner at investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital. ”I think ETH is acting like an institutional platform.”Read More: Ether, on Winning Streak, Surges, Tops Bank of America on Market CapThe price of bitcoin climbed Monday, going as high as $58,812 around 13:00 UTC (8 a.m. ET).

3706,"Cryptocurrency traders are always using the options market to bet that prices on digital assets such as bitcoin and ether and will soar – or crater. A lesser-known use for options trading is simply to bet on whether price swings, or volatility, will increase or decrease. And according to cryptocurrency market experts, the market is ripe for that kind of wager now. ""Bitcoin's short-dated option implied volatility is trading below realized volatility,"" crypto derivatives data provider Genesis Volatility wrote in its weekly newsletter published on Sunday. ""Ether's implied volatility is trading at a huge discount to the realized volatility."" When implied volatility is trading below historical volatility, it's a sign that the market is underpricing prospects for future price turbulence relative to recent price turbulence. Therefore, the implied volatility could rise and converge with and cross above the historical volatility, boosting options prices and yielding profits for buyers.""Buying options (call/put) in this environment is extremely interesting,"" Genesis Volatility said.Traders buy options when volatility is relatively cheap and sell when it's high. Volatility trading, therefore, is pretty simple at the core: It is based on the age-old investment adage of buy low and sell high. It is analogous to buying an asset in the spot market when it is perceived as undervalued and selling when it appears to be overvalued. Implied volatility refers to the market's expectation for price turbulence over a specific period, while historical or realized volatility represents volatility that has already played out.Volatility has a positive impact on options prices. Options are hedging instruments that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to purchase, and the put offers the right to sell. According to data provided by Genesis Volatility, ether's 10-day implied volatility is trading at 87% – well below the 10-day realized volatility of 97%. Bitcoin's 10-day implied volatility has been trading well below the 10-day historical volatility for close to two weeks; the gap, however, has narrowed somewhat in the past few days. At press time, the 10-day implied volatility stood at 69%, and the realized or historical volatility stood at 72%. Some traders take advantage of such situations by purchasing non-directional or market-neutral strategies such as straddles and strangles, which involve buying an equal number of calls and puts and benefiting from a spike in volatility. A long straddle is set up by purchasing a call and put option with the same expiration and strike price (usually nearest to the price of the underlying asset in the spot market). For example, with ether currently trading near $3,170, a trader anticipating a significant spike in implied volatility may set up a strangle by purchasing the May 28 expiry call and put options at the $3,200 strike price. A long strangle involves buying a call and put with the same expiry at strikes equidistant from the spot price. Buying an ether call at $3,300 and put at $3,100 would establish a long strangle.“Traders use strategies like long straddles and strangles, which involve buying both calls and puts when volatility is expected to increase,” said Luuk Strijers, founder and chief commercial officer of Deribit, the dominant crypto options exchange. “That’s more likely at the moment with the implied volatility below realized volatility.”Risk is predefined with these strategies, with the maximum loss limited to the extent of premium (options prices) paid while purchasing calls and puts. Straddles and strangles fail when the expected bump in implied volatility remains elusive till expiry. In such cases, options steadily lose value as expiration nears and become zero on the day of settlement. That said, returns can be sizable, as theoretically the underlying asset can rise to infinity, boosting implied volatility to the moon and generating a colossal profit on the long call position of the strategy. Similarly, an asset can fall to zero, yielding significant returns on the long put position of the strategy. As with other options strategies, traders consider multiple factors such as time left to expiration and macro news flow/events, along with implied volatility and historical volatility before taking long straddle/strangles. Also read: This Ether Options Play by Institutions Has Lottery Ticket Potential",2021-05-03

3708,"Say what you will about the social cost of securing the Bitcoin network, but it will never shoot anyone.The same promise cannot be made under the security model of today's fiat currencies.Bitcoin secures its scarcity, and therefore its value, using only cryptography and its proof-of-work system.Once upon a time, fiat currencies were secured by the value of gold. That stopped being the case in 1971 under President Richard Nixon, who declined to continue redeeming dollars for gold.So now the value of dollars (and other fiat currencies that float like the dollar does) is secured by the powers of the state: its economy, its credit and its revenue, all of which is ultimately secured by its military and police forces.This argument, it should be noted, is inspired by one of the latest in Nic Carter's ongoing series of posts on the issue of cryptocurrency and climate, but this post is not about global warming; this is about the application and the abnegation of institutional violence.At one point, Carter argues that if we're to compare the climate impact of different forms of money, one should factor in the climate impact of militaries that secure them. He writes:""Visa transactions are non-final credit transactions that rely on external underlying settlement rails. Visa relies on ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT, the global correspondent banking system, the Federal Reserve and, of course, the military and diplomatic strength of the U.S. government to ensure all of the above are working smoothly ...“The dollar’s ubiquity is partly due to a covert arrangement whereby the U.S. provides military support to countries like Saudi Arabia that agree to sell oil exclusively for dollars.""It would probably also make sense to throw police forces in here as well.Freely floating currencies are backed by the full faith and credit of the nation-state that issues them, but they are also backed by the state monopoly on violence.Hopefully, no one is going to quibble over whether states have the monopoly on violence. Peaceful dispute resolution is, like, the main point of government.If you and your neighbor have a dispute about who can plant a garden on which piece of dirt, it is no longer permissible to ""settle this like men."" Fisticuffs have been disallowed as a means of sorting out differences. It's a matter for the local magistrates and the courts, which in turn are backed by police forces enforcing their decisions.Today, those same forces also guarantee the monopoly on the issuance of currencies.For most of us, this is hardly even worth discussing. Why would anyone ever want to use anything but the state currency? It's so convenient! It has such great network effects! What kind of action would ever need to be taken to protect the monopoly of the thing that's so obviously the best thing to use?Except, crypto bans have been floated by nation-states several times around the world already.If a full-on ban were ever to be enacted, it won't be the accountants and the lawyers in the securities regulatory offices that go looking for folks hiding bitcoin. It will be state employees authorized to wear sidearms as fashion accessories who do it.An obvious objection to this post will be: Look, most states follow the lead of the U.S. and the U.S. has been pretty clear that it's fine with cryptocurrency in general – it just needs to hammer out some rules for it.This objection misses the point. The point is not whether states will or won't ban crypto. The point is that the U.S. could. It could use its police forces to maintain its monopoly rights over the money supply. The U.S. could try it; any nation-state with a police force could try it.So in that way it's not only the faith and credit securing the money supply, it's also the apparatus of violence. At the end of the day, all authority of any state comes down to a mixture of the will of the governed and the state's monopoly on violence. Some governments err more on one side and some err more on the other.But Bitcoin (and, for that matter, its progeny) will never show up at anyone's door to enforce its value in the market. Bitcoin is and always will be secured by cryptography, electricity and the network effect of its users. That's it.I can take this one step further: Let's get a bit science fiction-y and imagine that some ultra-powerful new codebreaking technology comes along and it beats the cryptography underlying bitcoin – all the private keys become public! All the secrets are exposed!What happens?Bitcoin just breaks. It's donezo. There's no fallback. F2 and Antpool don't have armies secreted away somewhere to come out and enforce whose wallets belong to whom.Many bitcoiners may be partial to firearms, but bitcoin itself has no use for them. The original cryptocurrency is as nonviolent as a hippie commune baked out of its mind once the marijuana harvest is ready. The dollar and its fiat family cannot say the same.",2021-05-03
3709,"We’ve all heard the expression “blockchain can change the world.” But maybe that’s not ambitious enough. Why stop at Planet Earth?Because for its next magic trick, blockchain is going to space. Maybe this shouldn’t be surprising because the overlap in the Venn diagram of Crypto Bros and Space Heads rivals that of Crypto and Burning Man. “These are very closely aligned groups,” says George Pullen, co-author of ""Blockchain and The Space Economy."" “If you are a blockchain devotee, then you have willingly projected forward a vision of the future that 95% to 99% of your peers don’t understand and don’t get. Space is the same way.”The flashiest example is Elon Musk, whose tweets are a mix of SpaceX updates and jokes about dogecoin. And then there’s Jeff Garzik, an early Bitcoin Core developer who’s also the co-founder and CTO of SpaceChain, a project whose mission is to integrate space and blockchain technologies. “I’m a big sci-fi nerd,” says Garzik, who has been hooked on space ever since his father took him to Cape Canaveral back in the 1980s to watch NASA shuttle launches. Thanks largely to the private sector’s surge of interest – what some call “Space Race 2.0” – Garzik predicts that within 10 years we’ll have Antarctica-style bases on the moon. Regular supply runs will keep these lunar bases stocked. “A three-day journey to the moon will be pretty normal,” he says. And once we have a true foothold on the moon it's just “another hop” to Mars because the shuttles will no longer need to fight earth’s gravity or atmosphere. “The moon in 10 [years], Mars in 20. That’s very realistic,” says Garzik.So how does blockchain fit into all of this?  “I am one of those first companies in the 1800s heading west, laying down railroad tracks,” says Garzik. “Blockchain is plumbing. Blockchain is infrastructure.” To mix the metaphors a bit, if Antarctica-style bases are to be built on the moon, then we’ll need the equivalent of cellphone towers to make those bases functional.   Every cellphone tower (or the space equivalent), every supply run to the moon, every launch of a satellite, and every video streamed from a Mars rover needs to be financed. In the glory days of the space race, that tab was paid for by NASA and the taxpayer. Today, the “space economy” is increasingly fueled by the private sector, and that capital doesn’t come from just one person. (Sorry, Elon.) “Not even billionaires want to write a check for a billion dollars,” says Garzik, explaining that space innovation will require a complicated system of fundraising, cooperation across multiple parties (who might not trust each other), and an alignment of economic incentives, which are all things at which blockchain is good.  SpaceChain’s network of smart contracts (using Ethereum) is designed to let multiple parties – potentially in adversarial countries – conduct transactions in that classic “trustless”  feature of blockchain. “Blockchain is kind of a neutral referee between multiple parties,” says Garzik. “That’s the key concept that I like to worm into people’s brains.” Space Race 2.0, says Pullen, might be less of a race than we think. “We keep seeing a narrative of ‘Space Race 2.0,' with people asking, is it going to be the U.S., China or Russia? That’s a story that makes people click but Space Race 2.0 is probably going to be a relay race, with people passing the baton back and forth,” he says, as the sprawling challenges will create a sharing economy. “And the best way to set up a sharing economy is with blockchain.” And then, if we succeed in setting up colonies in space? They will need a currency. “No dollar can survive the vacuum of space,” says Pullen. “No one’s taking dollars in space.” Bitcoin – or pick your favorite cryptocurrency – could be the logical solution.Then there’s the flip side to this coin. While SpaceChain uses blockchain technology to advance space exploration, others are using space to improve blockchain technology. This brings us to Blockstream. Founded by longtime cypherpunk Adam Back (inventor of Hashcash, a precursor to Bitcoin), Blockstream’s network of satellites allows anyone, anywhere on the planet, to transact in bitcoin. No internet required.  Those new to bitcoin often ask the question, “What happens if the internet goes down?” After all, outages happen. Equipment can malfunction. So if the internet breaks? “There’s a Bitcoin satellite network broadcasting the bitcoin blockchain that continues to work, even when large parts of the internet are damaged and offline,” says Back. Or let’s imagine a nation with political strife, where an authoritarian government muzzles the internet. “In this event,” says Back, “being able to transact with bitcoin could become of critical importance to pay for daily goods in a disrupted market, where card networks may cease to function, or to pay for emergency transport to a less dangerous locale.”Bitcoin-via-satellite offers a few other advantages. “Blockstream Satellite brings bitcoin users more privacy as it is a passive, receive-only service,” says Chris Cook, who heads up the Blockstream Satellite project. “Unlike with the Bitcoin [peer-to-peer] network, there are no other peers that can discover your IP address and potentially geo-locate your house address via mapping services.” It could also improve energy consumption. Blockstream leverages its satellites for their own mining operations – both as a backup connection to the Bitcoin network, and for remote areas where they can’t connect to the internet. That could be a glimpse of the future. Blockstream eventually aims to launch a satellite-based mining service, which will let anyone run a mining farm in a remote location. “We hope this will allow miners to access stranded and isolated energy that may be unused, or used inefficiently,” says Cook. In theory, this could spark new investments in renewable energy. For example, if you have solar panels and a Blockstream satellite connection, you could mine bitcoin in the middle of the desert.From the desert to the outer cosmos, it’s possible blockchain is ideally positioned to facilitate the new economics of space. One knock on blockchain is it’s a solution in search of a problem – a way to create an idyllic financial model when the old one still kind of works, more or less. Banks have their flaws but the system is functional, or at least quasi-functional for many. But in outer space? There’s no economic model yet. In space there is, quite literally, a void. Why couldn’t that void be filled by blockchain? This could be, as Garzik puts it, “science fiction becoming science fact.”",2021-05-03

3712,"Ether latest rally is being fueled by spot-market gains rather than by a build-up of leverage in the derivatives market, analysts said, potentially signaling that the price gains may have legs.The second-largest cryptocurrency rose to a record high of $3,201 early Monday, making its year-to-date gain over 330%, according to CoinDesk 20 data.""Ethereum's funding rates remain flat and went negative early today on FTX,"" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said. ""Our view is that the spot-driven rally for ETH is primarily due to excitement around the impending EIP 1559 upgrade.""The funding rate, calculated and paid every eight hours, refers to the cost of holding long positions in perpetuals (futures with no expiry). A high funding rate implies increased buying in the derivatives market, which doesn't appear to be the case with ether now.The average funding rate across major exchanges is barely holding above zero at press time, meaning the derivatives segment is far from overheated and the buying pressure is mainly stemming from spot markets. An overheated derivatives market typically leads to sudden price pullbacks similar to ones seen in January and mid-February after the funding rate reached highs above 0.15%.According to Swiss-based derivatives data provider Laevitas, the breakout above $3,000 could be long-lasting. ""Despite ether flying past $3,000, funding rates are completely flat. So this certainly feels like a sustainable spot-led rally,"" Laevitas tweeted early Monday.Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, said institutional buyers look to be accumulating the cryptocurrency. ""Roughly 400,000 ETH flowed out of Coinbase a few days ago. Speculative guess, institutions are now buying ether,"" Ju said on Twitter.Coinbase outflows are taken to represent institutional buying, as the exchange's custody wallets are directly integrated with its over-the-counter (OTC) desk. Institutions typically deal with OTC desks.Some investors look to be betting on a continued rally toward $5,000. Among all the options listed on the dominant crypto exchange Deribit, the most common open position is the $5,000 call, data shared by the options analytics platform Laevitas shows.The total open interest in the $5,000 call is 69,000 contracts at press time. Of that, 15,970 are due to expire at the end of May and 18,400 at the end of June.A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. In plain English, a call option is a bullish bet.The bullish sentiment likely stems from analysts predicting a considerable drop in ether's annual issuance following the EIP 1559 upgrade – a proposal to change Ethereum's fee structure, also known as ""Ethereum's scarcity engine"" or ""ETH's burn mechanism"".That said, the options market currently sees less than a 10% probability of ether ending the second quarter above $5,000, according to data source Skew. The cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to the effects of sharp bitcoin price pullbacks. Also read: Ether Breaks Above $3K for the First Time Ever",2021-05-03
3713,"Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, surged Monday to a new record price of over $3,200 amid fresh speculation the network's value might soar as more traders warm to the potential of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, and other uses like non-fungible tokens or NFTs. The 10% gain was the biggest in two months, and the new all-time high price of $3,253 came just hours after the market topped $3,000 for the first time. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has risen for nine straight days, its longest winning streak since the bull market of late 2017 and early 2018. The ether price has quadrupled just this year alone, outperforming bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, which has doubled. Ether now has a market capitalization of $364 billion, exceeding that of Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank, as well as that of the entertainment giant Walt Disney and food conglomerate Nestle. The latest price move comes amid signs of growing interest in ether from big institutional investors and Wall Street firms – similar to the dynamic that propelled bitcoin to a market capitalization over $1 trillion earlier this year. Late last week, the Wall Street investment-research firm FundStrat predicted ether could surge to $10,000 this year, powered by enthusiasm over DeFi's growth and advances in Internet-based financial applications. ""It used to be the other way around, but now Bitcoin is riding the coattails of Ethereum,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the brokerage Oanda, wrote Monday in an email.    The daily transaction count has increased by 22% to 1.376 million this year, per data provided by Glassnode. The Ethereum network settled $1.5 million in transactions in the first quarter alone, more than the combined tally of the previous seven quarters.“These applications are generating ~3x fees for the Ethereum network vs. Bitcoin, which trades at ~3x the market cap,” FundStrat's David Grider wrote.Even analysts for JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, have acknowledged the network's promise – despite some predictions that the success of DeFi's automated, blockchain-based trading and lending applications might eventually steal market share from traditional financial firms. “In combination with the continued growth for DeFi and other components of the Ethereum-based economy, this suggests some technical but occasionally important bullish tailwinds versus bitcoin,"" according to JPMorgan. The network CoinMetrics data shows the number of active addresses recently climbed to a new all-time high of 771,000, surpassing the previous record of 739,000 set in November. And according to DeFi Pulse, which tracks use of DeFi applications, the amount of collateral locked in decentralized trading, lending and insurance applications has climbed to $72 billion, a fourfold increase so far in 2021. The figure was less than $1 billion at the start of 2020. The total market capitalization for DeFi recently topped $100 billion, with some of the most popular projects, like Uniswap and Compound, built on the Ethereum blockchain.“Ether is one of the main beneficiaries in the wider explosion in the cryptocurrency market,"" Nigel Green, chief executive officer of deVere Group, wrote in emailed comments. ""The boom over recent months has been fueled by soaring interest from major institutional investors and growing recognition that borderless digital currencies are the future of money."" Some traders are buying options to bet on further gains – including the prospect of a rally in the ether price to $5,000 by the end of May. One catalyst might be the so-called Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, or EIP 1559, which is designed to make transactions on the blockchain more efficient. But it could also counteract any inflation that comes from new supplies of the cryptocurrency being mined into existence. The change, approved in March, is supposed to take effect in July as part of a network upgrade known as the London hard fork.   ""Investors are just starting to digest the potential impact on the economics of Ethereum,"" Martin Gaspar, a research analyst at CrossTower, said Monday on CoinDesk TV's First Mover show. Additional excitement comes from Ethereum's planned ""Eth 2.0"" upgrade, which will transform the network from using the energy-hungry proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, similar to bitcoin's, to a more capital-intensive proof-of-stake (PoS) system. A consensus mechanism is the system a blockchain uses to confirm transactions and assure network security. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin gave a presentation recently on the network's development roadmap after its merge to proof-of-stake, including a long-awaited feature known as sharding that could boost transaction throughput and speed. Sharding will expand Ethereum’s capacity to process transactions by splitting its database into 64 new mini-blockchains, addressing network congestion. High fees on the Ethereum blockchain has been a nagging source of complaints among users, spurring the growing use of rival blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain, which is affiliated with Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Cryptocurrency traders have bid up prices for Binance's BNB token as well as digital assets associated with so-called Ethereum killers, include Solana and Polkadot.Ether ""is already years ahead of bitcoin in everything but price and fame,"" according to deVere's Green. ""There’s a real sense that 2021 is the year for ether. Its time has come.”",2021-05-03
3714,"During a continued divergence in the crypto markets, where ether posted new all-time highs while bitcoin wallowed at levels almost $10,000 below its peak, the politics and buzz around both continue to spur thought and debate. In the spirit of that, this week’s newsletter dives into Iran’s ostensibly pro-bitcoin strategy and shows how it contravenes the level playing field values on which bitcoin is built. It also looks at the explosion in non-fungible token (NFT) sales and offers a lesson from Crypto Twitter on how to deal with rumors. After you’ve read all that, please find time to listen to this week’s excellent episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast. In the latest stop on our world tour of crypto hot spots, Sheila Warren and I talk to two Nigerian entrepreneurs: Yele Bademosi, the CEO of payments app Bundle Africa, and Adia Sowho, a venture builder and operator. Among this entertaining pair’s many cool insights was the idea the Nigerian Central Bank’s February order that banks shut down crypto companies’ access backfired. It spurred even more innovation, inspiring local developers to dream up new decentralized solutions for getting around the banking sector’s gatekeepers.Be careful what you wish for. News this week that Iran will allow a small set of qualified entities to pay for imports with cryptocurrency mined by licensed operators might sound like an enlightened move to some bitcoin enthusiasts. It fits a narrative that when governments start accepting bitcoin, they jump-start its role as a universal reserve asset. Meanwhile, the free trade-minded who chafe at all government intervention in markets may view Iran’s use of bitcoin to get around U.S. sanctions as a positive blow for global commerce generally.But look closer and you’ll see in Iran’s bitcoin strategy the hallmarks of an authoritarian system that flouts the freedoms crypto advocates like to embrace. When viewed alongside a crackdown against unlicensed crypto mining, the regime’s moves could widen the divide between government-favored elites and average Iranians. (Below we delve into the lessons on this taken from Cuba’s destructive dual-currency system.)It’s not clear if federal officials in Washington will care about that inequity. But it will view Iran’s bitcoin solution for sanction avoidance with alarm, as it undermines the United States’ self-appointed role as cop to the global financial system. Concerns about that will be amplified if it’s apparent that China, which is eager to knock the dollar off its international reserve currency perch, is directly or indirectly supporting Iran’s approach. (The pathways for Beijing to do so are already laid.)The question is: How should the Biden administration respond? Let’s hope it avoids the temptation to roll this into a simplistic “bitcoin bad” narrative and imposes tighter controls on the cryptocurrency’s users in the U.S. and elsewhere. A more constructive approach would encourage Iran to abandon its strategy for a crypto policy that favors innovation, green infrastructure and economic freedom for all its citizens. The intent of the government of President Hassan Rouhani is hardly a mystery. Even though Iran is a major oil producer, years of crippling U.S. sanctions aimed at containing its nuclear weapons program have deprived its economy of dollars. That makes it very difficult for Iran to buy what it needs from the world, and ensures that the local currency, the rial, is under perpetual downward pressure, which in turn stokes inflation.Now, by creating a legal framework in which bitcoin can be mined locally, taxed under a strict licensing system and used by regulated institutions to pay for imports, the government has a workaround. Iran will still struggle to sell its energy resources for dollars, but it can do the next best thing: It can convert that same local resource into bitcoin, a harder currency than dollars. At the same time, the regime is showing its authoritarian instincts. In January, it said that Iran had 24 officially registered mining farms, consuming 310 megawatts of power, and that the Ministry of Energy had shut down 1,620 illegal bitcoin mining operations with a capacity of 250 megawatts over the prior 18 months. It offered rewards of up to 100 million rials ($2,350) for information leading to the arrest of illegal miners. In a subsequent story by CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova, one household miner, “Basir” (not his real name), said he spent a week in jail before he could scrounge up the large bail amount by selling his house, his car and his mining equipment. The premise for the crackdown is that illegal mining is disrupting Iran’s overstretched electricity grid. But bitcoin advocates say that is unfair as the country’s blackouts have continued even after the authorities have done their sweep. Regardless, by making itself the gatekeeper for domestically mined bitcoin and discriminating over which entities can access it, the government is laying the groundwork for societal divisions  – especially if bitcoin grows in importance, as many expect it will. To understand why, let’s go back to the early years of the post-Cold War era in Cuba, another country that has labored under the constraints of U.S. sanctions.In 1993, Fidel Castro’s regime was broke. Its longtime benefactor, the Soviet Union, had collapsed and the island economy was reeling from four years of “Special Period” austerity. Castro reluctantly adopted a radical solution: He legalized the use of U.S. dollars, but only within designated, closely regulated industries such as government-sanctioned tourism resorts that could only accept foreigners as guests. It later entrenched this system by requiring all incoming foreign currency, including that carried by foreign tourists, be exchanged into “convertible pesos,” a new local currency pegged one-to-one with the dollar. The new notes would circulate in parallel with the traditional Cuban peso, known as “moneda nacional” (national currency), but could only be used in those same sanctioned settings. The strategy gave the regime a lifeline. With taxes from regulated foreign currency inflows, it continued to defy the Helms-Burton Act. But the system created two Cubas, one where a privileged elite got access to goods and services available only in de facto foreign currency. Everyone else earned near-worthless moneda nacional, which could buy only items listed on the “libreta,” or ration book, an artifact of Soviet communism that guaranteed necessities such as bread and milk but excluded anything deemed to be a “luxury” – in effect, anything imported. To give you an idea of how limiting the libreta was, it did not include the “luxury” of tampons. These deep divisions also bred rampant corruption because goods designated for the moneda nacional economy were hoarded and sold illegally in the convertible peso economy. Bakers would secretly deliver half their production to fancy foreign tourist-only restaurants, denying libreta holders their bread rations. Gas stations would siphon off gasoline intended for domestic customers and deliver it to companies operating in the convertible peso economy. Painters would thin out their paint so that they could sell half their supplies to hotels.  The human effect of this stood out to me when I visited Cuba for book research in 2008. One day, I hired a rickshaw driver with my convertible pesos. Every time he saw a policeman up ahead, he urged me to dismount and walk to meet him two blocks down the road because he  couldn’t be seen to be servicing dollar-wielding foreign tourists. The system created a new class of predominantly white elites whose expat families in Miami and Madrid would send them foreign currency, while doing nothing for a disproportionately black community without such ties. By the standards of Communist Cuba’s professed egalitarian ideals, it was an abomination. Yet, it took the government 28 years – until January of this year – to unify the currencies. Such was the intoxicating appeal of this unjust system for the Castro dictatorship – first under Fidel, then under his brother, Raul.Similar inequity lies ahead for Iran if it sticks with its crypto strategy and, as many of us believe, bitcoin becomes a sought-after store of value in a post-COVID era of high debt, slow growth and fiat currency depreciation. Some Iranians will become phenomenally rich. Others will be stuck with worthless rials. Attempts to cross the divide will encourage corruption and social tensions. Still, for the Iranian regime, the strategy is a tempting way to fund itself. Also, given Iran’s relationship with China – with which it recently struck a $400 billion, 25-year investment deal that included access to Iranian oil and a plan for a binational “bank” – it presents an opportunity to shift the geopolitical landscape. China has the largest bitcoin mining industry in the world, and so it’s not hard to imagine Chinese bitcoin miners building officially endorsed, fossil fuel-run facilities inside Iran. Once bilateral payment agreements are in place to use digital currencies that bypass the U.S.-led global financial system, one can foresee a feedback loop in which China gets oil, Iran gets hard currency, the dollar’s power is diminished, and bitcoin’s carbon footprint grows. How should the U.S. respond?My fear is the rallying cry in Congress will be that bitcoin is “enabling” reprehensible sanctions-busting behavior, prompting calls for tougher crypto regulations. That will only drive more activity underground and encourage more dirty fuel installations in Iran and elsewhere –  in effect, strengthening the regime’s hand. The alternative is the U.S. government takes a more constructive approach, encouraging innovation and economic freedom. It could offer to work with domestic bitcoin miners to commit to zero greenhouse emissions and, in so doing, develop such energy sources, whether it’s the government’s nuclear plants or locally run solar and wind operations. As I wrote in a prior newsletter, I see a pathway for government incentives to make bitcoin mining a catalyst for green energy development. Iran, as an energy powerhouse, is well placed to work with U.S. scientists on such solutions. One can hope, right?With “Saturday Night Live” making skits about NFTs, multiple sports stars and celebrities minting them and digital art selling for nosebleed prices, it seems like a good time to check in on how the NFT market has responded to all this attention. Thankfully, the latest quarterly report from ConsenSys on the state of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Ethereum contains a nice set of pie charts to tell the story:As expected, sales of crypto art grew rapidly during the quarter as a mania for non-fungible tokens took hold. However, the spoils of the growing pie were not distributed evenly. Nifty Gateway, the NFT platform acquired by Gemini two years ago, has consistently gobbled up the biggest piece of it.Why? In one word: Beeple. The March $69 million sale of the digital artist’s ""Everydays – The First Five Thousand Days"" digital collage was not only a major driver of the platform’s volume, it also reflected the established relationship Beeple had already built with Christie’s, Nifty Gateway and other sellers of high-value digital art.Herein lies an old-school journalist’s crotchety warnings about treating rumors responsibly. Crypto Twitter can take some lessons from a saga that began with a tweet early Tuesday by Alistair Milne, whose Twitter profile (89,300 followers) says he is the CIO of the Altana Digital Currency Fund.That got many, many, people excited – for obvious reasons. Bitcoin’s price did not immediately jump after the tweet, but for the 36-hour period (until the rumor turned out to be false), it brushed with its highest level for the week. Knowing the trigger-happiness of the crypto investor scene, it seems likely that Milne’s tweet, which was very widely shared, prompted many to buy. Now, before we discuss what Facebook actually announced, here’s a basic rule to which I was rightly subjected in financial newsrooms throughout my career: We could never report on potentially market-moving rumors, however interesting they might be, for the simple reason that you could cause people to unfairly lose or gain money on unsubstantiated hearsay. Rumors are prevalent in all markets, precisely because people have vested interests in the price impact they can have. The last thing you want to do as a respected news outlet with a large megaphone is to amplify the rumormonger’s message. A rumor is a prompt for a journalist to try to confirm the truth of it, not to report on it prematurely. Of course, Milne is not a journalist. But in the age of social media, and for the purposes of this discussion, it’s a distinction without a difference. He has 89,000 followers and a reputation as an early investor in the space. We all have a responsibility to our audience. Anyway...Facebook’s earnings came and went on Wednesday evening with nary a mention of “bitcoin,” “cryptocurrency,” “blockchain,” “dogecoin,” or even “libra” or, for that matter, “diem.”Some delighted in the non-eventness of it all:But others were incensed. This Twitter user summed up Crypto Twitter’s reaction quite nicely (sound on):As Milne came under attack, he stood his ground. He didn’t delete the tweet and found some lighthearted ways to laugh it off, asking whether he should delete his account and then declaring he would never tweet again until Facebook does buy bitcoin. But his mentions kept filling up. It probably didn’t help he had tweet-boasted 14 hours before the Facebook earnings release of taking profits, nor that he later defensively blamed the rumor on someone else.Here, two old-school newsroom rules are useful: 1) the problem is not that you start a rumor per se, it’s that you amplify it and in so doing legitimize it, and 2) just putting the label “rumor” on an unsubstantiated claim does not get you off the hook. You’re still amplifying it.That last tweet, 22 hours after the Facebook earnings report, suggests our culprit still has some learning to do.Still, it’s heartening to know that an angry Twitter mob can have a sobering impact. Based on this last tweet from Alistair Milne on the topic Thursday night, he might think twice next time:Bitcoin investors are hoping the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finally approves an exchange-traded fund for bitcoin, giving the price a boost. With at least three proposals before an SEC that’s now led by crypto-savvy Chairman Gary Gensler, and given the success of three Canadian ETFs, expectations are stronger than ever for a positive ruling.",2021-04-30
3715,"The next time someone smugly tells you there is “no legitimate use case” for cryptocurrency, or asserts that it has “no redeeming social value,” shove this story in his or her face:Meduza, a Russian news outlet, is soliciting donations in cryptocurrency (along with traditional payment methods) after the government labeled it a “foreign agent,” CoinDesk’s on-the-ground correspondent, Anna Baydakova, reported Thursday.Meduza is now required by law to post a notice of its “foreign agent” status in a typeface bigger than the text of its articles. As a result of this scarlet letter, Meduza lost many of its advertisers and is running out of money, the team behind the publication said. Apparently, it hasn’t been deplatformed by traditional financial institutions because it is also taking donations by bank card and PayPal. But the reasons Meduza gave for including the crypto option were telling.“If people are afraid to send us money from their bank accounts, and they might well be, they can send us crypto,” said Meduza’s editor-in-chief, Ivan Kolpakov.A skeptic might note that donors who send bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or BNB to Meduza would leave a permanent record of their actions on the blockchains, or public ledgers, of these assets. But such a record would show only the address, a random-seeming string of numbers and letters, that sent the money, not the person behind it. An address may or may not be tied to donors’ real-world identity, depending on how they acquired the crypto and what steps they took to protect their privacy, whereas their bank and PayPal accounts definitely are.Further, if recent history teaches us anything, it is that financial intermediaries cannot be relied upon to stand with dissident or unpopular voices.We saw this more than a decade ago with the blockade of WikiLeaks by PayPal and other large financial institutions that caved to extra-legal pressure from U.S. politicians.We see it today when payment processors and crowdfunding sites boot content creators, fundraisers or pariah-friendly internet platforms, not because they are breaking any laws but because their speech offends activists. I, too, find the content in many of these cases unsavory. But I don’t mind that it exists, and I don’t want to prevent those who want to read, watch or hear it from doing so. That’s a basic “small-l liberal” principle. Or was.To quote a locked Twitter account, whom I will not name out of respect for the person's privacy: “If I cover my ears because I don’t want to hear from you, it’s not censorship. If I cover your mouth or someone else’s ears because people want to hear you, it’s censorship.”I can already hear the bien pensants say, “It’s only censorship when the government does it.” But even if you accept only that narrow legal definition of the word, it surely describes what the Russian government – the very regime whose influence in the U.S. many of those same bien pensants spent the last four years hyperventilating about – is trying to do to Meduza.Crypto might thwart that attempt, or at least hinder it, by enabling individuals to transfer money to a publisher without permission from third parties that can be strong-armed or politicized.By all means, let’s talk about the copious amounts of electricity required to secure Bitcoin and other proof-of-stake networks – although describing this intensive computation as “wasteful” is a subjective value judgment. (TikTok and hair dryers are wasteful in my book. Should those things be banned?)By all means, let’s acknowledge that cryptocurrency’s openness to all comers makes it attractive to criminals – although the blockchain’s trail of crumbs also helps law enforcement catch the crooks who use these systems.See also: Daniel Kuhn – Bitcoin, Warts and AllBy all means, let’s pay attention to how terrorists, foreign or now, we’re told, domestic, might take advantage of this technology. But if we’re going to blame anyone or anything other than the terrorists for their actions, remember it was not Satoshi Nakamoto who destabilized the Middle East or hollowed out Middle America.When tallying the social costs of censorship-resistant money, do not ignore the benefits for the Meduzas of the world.",2021-04-30
3716,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices surged Friday as the market appeared largely unfazed by the expiration of more than $4 billion of options earlier in the day. Historical price patterns suggest the largest cryptocurrency may be due for further gains over the coming weeks.Since October the settlement of the monthly options contracts has proven to be a catalyst for bullish short-term moves. In the 10 days following the past six monthly expiries, the cryptocurrency has charted gains ranging from 7% to 35%.Last month, prices pulled back to $50,000 in the week leading up to the March 26 expiry, only to reverse course in the following days and reach new record highs above $64,000 on April 14. A similar dynamic unfolded before and after the February and January expiries.One possible explanation for the month-end pullbacks was that the ""max pain point"" – the strike price at which the most open options contracts expire worthless – was so far below the spot price. Such a setup raises the risk that some traders might try to push the market down so that the options would be in the money at expiration.    For instance, the max pain point for the March 26 expiry was $44,000, and the cryptocurrency traded near $60,000 a week before expiry. That likely prompted options sellers – typically institutions – to create bearish pressure in the spot/futures market and push prices closer to the max pain point in a bid to inflict maximum loss on options buyers.This time around, the max pain point for the April expiry, which took place at 08:00 UTC Friday, was $54,000, according to Deribit, the dominant exchange for trading cryptocurrency options. Prices fell from $60,000 to $48,000 in the eight days to April 25. However, the cryptocurrency bounced back over the next few days. By the time of Friday's expiration, the price was right around the max pain point of $54,000. Most options expired worthless or out of the money.

3720,"Former crypto-friendly Florida tax collector Joel Greenberg attempted to use bitcoin to pay for a presidential pardon, The Daily Beast reported Thursday. Greenberg offered to send $250,000 in the cryptocurrency to Roger Stone, a political consultant tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump, as a fee for Stone securing a pardon for Greenberg, The Daily Beast said, citing screenshots of Signal messages the former Florida official allegedly sent. “If I get you $250K in bitcoin, would that help or is this not a financial matter?” Greenberg reportedly wrote.The disclosure is part of a broader story about U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who is reportedly being investigated by federal officials for an alleged sexual relationship with a minor.Federal prosecutors have charged Greenberg with a number of legal violations, including sex trafficking of a child. Gaetz, a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, is said to be under investigation as part of Greenberg’s case, and Greenberg is cooperating with the investigation, according to the New York Times.The Daily Beast reported Thursday it had also acquired a confession letter Greenberg wrote as part of his effort to secure a pardon. The letter implicates Gaetz in the allegations of sex with a minor, according to the news site.“On more than one occasion, this individual was involved in sexual activities with several of the other girls, the congressman from Florida’s 1st Congressional District and myself,” Greenberg is reported to have penned in late 2020.Gas money, gifts, rent or partial tuition payments are among the methods Greenberg alleges he and Gaetz used, including to the individual under the age of 18, according to the article. Payments using Square's Cash App, PayPal's Venmo and other tools were made to the girls on “behalf of the congressman,” according to the report.A spokesperson for Gaetz did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday night.",2021-04-30
3721,"Jason Somensatto, a former lawyer at decentralized exchange project 0x Labs, is the new acting director of LabCFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) financial technology research division.Somensatto will take over from Melissa Netram, who departed the post in early April. Before joining the CFTC in February, he was a senior counsel at 0x, whose ZRX token was the first ERC-20 token to be listed on Coinbase’s professional trading platform. 0x raised $24 million in an initial coin offering in 2017.Somensatto declined to comment when reached, but the current LabCFTC “Team” page confirms his role.While a number of high-profile regulators have recently taken positions in crypto businesses, Somensatto is one of the individuals moving the other way this year.In a statement, Acting CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam praised Somensatto’s appointment. “I am grateful that Jason has agreed to serve as the Acting Director of LabCFTC,” he said. “Given his experience and deep knowledge of the digital asset marketplace, I am confident he will continue supporting the agency’s important role within this evolving space.”Prior to Somensatto’s tenure, LabCFTC was headed by Daniel Gorfine, the first director of the CFTC office, and Netram, who took over in October 2019.That same month, then-Chairman Heath Tarbert announced the division would be spun out into its own independent office, reporting directly to the CFTC chair. The group acts as a research division within the federal regulator, publishing primers on the crypto industry as well as “Requests for Input” on issues like Ethereum and the surrounding market.The CFTC oversees all derivatives and other commodity products in the U.S., and is the regulator responsible for green-lighting bitcoin and ether futures products. The agency is also nominally responsible for spotting potential fraud or manipulation in the markets of some other cryptocurrencies, like litecoin and dogecoin.While President Joe Biden’s nominee to head the U.S. federal securities regulator, Gary Gensler, was recently confirmed to his post by the Senate, there’s no clear picture yet of who Biden will tap to lead the CFTC on a permanent basis. ",2021-04-29
3722,"Better enforcement of cryptocurrency regulations can help address an increasing number of ransomware attacks, a public-private task force claimed Thursday.The Ransomware Task Force, led by the Institute for Security and Technology with support from Microsoft, McAfee and various government agencies, published a report proposing a host of government and company responses to the growing threat of ransomware attacks, including recommendations to disrupt payments to the developers who develop this form of malware.A ransomware attack is one where a malicious actor hijacks a computer or network, locking it until the victim pays a ransom, often in cryptocurrency (ransomware victims paid close to $350 million in crypto to attackers last year). Paying the ransom is not necessarily a guarantee the perpetrator will share a decryption tool to unlock the computer.The report recommended properly enforcing existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws to help tamp down payments made in crypto, and hinted that additional regulations may be necessary.“The cryptocurrency sector that enables ransomware crime should be more closely regulated. Governments should require cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto kiosks, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading ‘desks’ to comply with existing laws, including Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Combatting Financing of Terrorism (CFT) laws,” the report said.The report noted that this sort of regulatory enforcement would have to be international. A single nation enforcing KYC/AML laws would be insufficient, given that some companies set up shop in countries with more lax regulations.“A single country’s laws or capabilities will be insufficient to tackle this global threat,” the report said.Kemba Walden, an assistant general counsel at Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, said in a panel announcing the report that many ransomware developers want payments in bitcoin, rather than privacy coins.This is because of the low trading volumes for these privacy coins, the report said. However, while malicious actors may not be using privacy coins, the report did warn that attackers might use mixing services to obfuscate how transactions occur.Chainalysis Director of Market Development Don Spies, who is a member of the task force, told CoinDesk the group came together around the idea that the ransomware threat is likely to grow.“I think one of the main goals of this was not to propose additional, stifling measures but to help folks realize that you can actually take a stab at this with existing measures,” he said. “In the regulatory space, AML, if we just enforce existing laws on the books in a consistent manner, I think we have the ability to really combat what’s going on.”Pamela Clegg, vice president of financial investigations at CipherTrace, said in a blog post one of the goals would be to disrupt the ransomware business model, saying crypto is just one aspect of the issue.The task force received support from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Europol, with members hailing from a host of government agencies and private entities. Spies said he volunteered to join the group, and was not paid for his participation.In video remarks at the unveiling of the report, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called the report an “impressive accomplishment.”“The Department will work to implement many of your recommendations because one thing is clear: Ransomware is a threat to national security,” Mayorkas said. ",2021-04-29
3723,"Traders and analysts continue to talk up ether and alternative cryptocurrencies as bitcoin struggles to regain the $64,000 record price level attained weeks ago.The price of bitcoin was dropping Thursday, going as low as $52,622 and settling at $52,964 as of press time. There’s been an almost $3,000 price change over the past 24 hours for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, ranging from $55,851 down to $52,622.It’s the season for alternative cryptocurrencies, or “alts,” according to Rich Rosenblum, president of crypto market maker GSR. This might help explain why bitcoin has suddenly lost some of the momentum seen earlier this week. “When new money flows into BTC, people are less focused on alts,” Rosenblum told CoinDesk. “Once it feels like the bullish pattern for BTC breaks down, people roll some of those profits into alts.”The market dominance of bitcoin continues to decline, and it’s less than half of the total blockchain market Thursday. At 49.5% at press time it is down from 73% at the start of 2021. “Crypto natives might be taking profits in BTC to free up some capital to invest in alts,” Rosenblum said.Zachary Friedman, chief operating officer at quantitative firm GDA Capital, senses bitcoin’s rally might just be pausing.  “As we have seen with most bull cycles, bitcoin typically leads the charge,” Friedman said. “Once bitcoin tops, money is redistributed into altcoins, which marks the nearing end of these cycles, historically.”While ether keeps pushing to new highs almost daily, bitcoin’s all-time high above $64,400 came two weeks ago. For now, BTC is out of the limelight. “Ether and alts will likely keep up the bulk of the action for the next leg of this cycle,” Friedman said. Read More: Coinbase Debuts ‘Buy With PayPal’ Feature (but Read the Fine Print)Ether (ETH) rallied to a fresh all-time high Thursday around $2,800, before fading later in the day.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading around $2,708 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), down 0.75% over the prior 24 hours. “Since the end of March, we’ve seen ETH going stronger against BTC,” said Élie Le Rest, partner at crypto quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. The technical proposal EIP 1559 to fix the Ethereum blockchain’s problematic capacity constraints may be aiding in the bullish sentiment. “This bullish trend on ETH may be seen through different angles, but the upcoming upgrade including EIP 1559 is seen as a strong catalyst of the recent ETH bull run,” Le Rest said. Jason Lau, chief operating office of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin, said ether appears to have decoupled from bitcoin. “This is significant as ETH/BTC had been in the ~0.02-0.04 BTC range for almost the past two years, but recently just hit ~0.05 BTC” Lau said. As of press time, the ETH/BTC pair, which signals traders rotating in and out of bitcoin into and from ether, is up 2.6% and well over 0.05 BTC. It has been mega bullish since April 27. “The [non-fungible token] boom, recent scalability improvements, Ethereum protocol upgrades and DeFi growth have all contributed,” Lau said. “Those upcoming features are a great incentive for investors to tag along, contributing to ETH against BTC” Read More: As Ether Pushes Ever Higher, Crypto Traders Plot Price in Bitcoin TermsOne of the biggest gainers in the altcoin space this year is Binance coin (BNB),  an asset used to offset trading fees charged on the Binance exchange.

3724,"During a continued divergence in the crypto markets, where ether posted new all-time highs while bitcoin wallowed at levels almost $10,000 below its peak, the politics and buzz around both continue to spur thought and debate. In the spirit of that, this week’s newsletter dives into Iran’s ostensibly pro-bitcoin strategy and shows how it contravenes the level playing field values on which bitcoin is built. It also looks at the explosion in non-fungible token (NFT) sales and offers a lesson from Crypto Twitter on how to deal with rumors. After you’ve read all that, please find time to listen to this week’s excellent episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast. In the latest stop on our world tour of crypto hot spots, Sheila Warren and I talk to two Nigerian entrepreneurs: Yele Bademosi, the CEO of payments app Bundle Africa, and Adia Sowho, a venture builder and operator. Among this entertaining pair’s many cool insights was the idea the Nigerian Central Bank’s February order that banks shut down crypto companies’ access backfired. It spurred even more innovation, inspiring local developers to dream up new decentralized solutions for getting around the banking sector’s gatekeepers.Be careful what you wish for. News this week that Iran will allow a small set of qualified entities to pay for imports with cryptocurrency mined by licensed operators might sound like an enlightened move to some bitcoin enthusiasts. It fits a narrative that when governments start accepting bitcoin, they jump-start its role as a universal reserve asset. Meanwhile, the free trade-minded who chafe at all government intervention in markets may view Iran’s use of bitcoin to get around U.S. sanctions as a positive blow for global commerce generally.But look closer and you’ll see in Iran’s bitcoin strategy the hallmarks of an authoritarian system that flouts the freedoms crypto advocates like to embrace. When viewed alongside a crackdown against unlicensed crypto mining, the regime’s moves could widen the divide between government-favored elites and average Iranians. (Below we delve into the lessons on this taken from Cuba’s destructive dual-currency system.)It’s not clear if federal officials in Washington will care about that inequity. But it will view Iran’s bitcoin solution for sanction avoidance with alarm, as it undermines the United States’ self-appointed role as cop to the global financial system. Concerns about that will be amplified if it’s apparent that China, which is eager to knock the dollar off its international reserve currency perch, is directly or indirectly supporting Iran’s approach. (The pathways for Beijing to do so are already laid.)The question is: How should the Biden administration respond? Let’s hope it avoids the temptation to roll this into a simplistic “bitcoin bad” narrative and imposes tighter controls on the cryptocurrency’s users in the U.S. and elsewhere. A more constructive approach would encourage Iran to abandon its strategy for a crypto policy that favors innovation, green infrastructure and economic freedom for all its citizens. The intent of the government of President Hassan Rouhani is hardly a mystery. Even though Iran is a major oil producer, years of crippling U.S. sanctions aimed at containing its nuclear weapons program have deprived its economy of dollars. That makes it very difficult for Iran to buy what it needs from the world, and ensures that the local currency, the rial, is under perpetual downward pressure, which in turn stokes inflation.Now, by creating a legal framework in which bitcoin can be mined locally, taxed under a strict licensing system and used by regulated institutions to pay for imports, the government has a workaround. Iran will still struggle to sell its energy resources for dollars, but it can do the next best thing: It can convert that same local resource into bitcoin, a harder currency than dollars. At the same time, the regime is showing its authoritarian instincts. In January, it said that Iran had 24 officially registered mining farms, consuming 310 megawatts of power, and that the Ministry of Energy had shut down 1,620 illegal bitcoin mining operations with a capacity of 250 megawatts over the prior 18 months. It offered rewards of up to 100 million rials ($2,350) for information leading to the arrest of illegal miners. In a subsequent story by CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova, one household miner, “Basir” (not his real name), said he spent a week in jail before he could scrounge up the large bail amount by selling his house, his car and his mining equipment. The premise for the crackdown is that illegal mining is disrupting Iran’s overstretched electricity grid. But bitcoin advocates say that is unfair as the country’s blackouts have continued even after the authorities have done their sweep. Regardless, by making itself the gatekeeper for domestically mined bitcoin and discriminating over which entities can access it, the government is laying the groundwork for societal divisions  – especially if bitcoin grows in importance, as many expect it will. To understand why, let’s go back to the early years of the post-Cold War era in Cuba, another country that has labored under the constraints of U.S. sanctions.In 1993, Fidel Castro’s regime was broke. Its longtime benefactor, the Soviet Union, had collapsed and the island economy was reeling from four years of “Special Period” austerity. Castro reluctantly adopted a radical solution: He legalized the use of U.S. dollars, but only within designated, closely regulated industries such as government-sanctioned tourism resorts that could only accept foreigners as guests. It later entrenched this system by requiring all incoming foreign currency, including that carried by foreign tourists, be exchanged into “convertible pesos,” a new local currency pegged one-to-one with the dollar. The new notes would circulate in parallel with the traditional Cuban peso, known as “moneda nacional” (national currency), but could only be used in those same sanctioned settings. The strategy gave the regime a lifeline. With taxes from regulated foreign currency inflows, it continued to defy the Helms-Burton Act. But the system created two Cubas, one where a privileged elite got access to goods and services available only in de facto foreign currency. Everyone else earned near-worthless moneda nacional, which could buy only items listed on the “libreta,” or ration book, an artifact of Soviet communism that guaranteed necessities such as bread and milk but excluded anything deemed to be a “luxury” – in effect, anything imported. To give you an idea of how limiting the libreta was, it did not include the “luxury” of tampons. These deep divisions also bred rampant corruption because goods designated for the moneda nacional economy were hoarded and sold illegally in the convertible peso economy. Bakers would secretly deliver half their production to fancy foreign tourist-only restaurants, denying libreta holders their bread rations. Gas stations would siphon off gasoline intended for domestic customers and deliver it to companies operating in the convertible peso economy. Painters would thin out their paint so that they could sell half their supplies to hotels.  The human effect of this stood out to me when I visited Cuba for book research in 2008. One day, I hired a rickshaw driver with my convertible pesos. Every time he saw a policeman up ahead, he urged me to dismount and walk to meet him two blocks down the road because he  couldn’t be seen to be servicing dollar-wielding foreign tourists. The system created a new class of predominantly white elites whose expat families in Miami and Madrid would send them foreign currency, while doing nothing for a disproportionately black community without such ties. By the standards of Communist Cuba’s professed egalitarian ideals, it was an abomination. Yet, it took the government 28 years – until January of this year – to unify the currencies. Such was the intoxicating appeal of this unjust system for the Castro dictatorship – first under Fidel, then under his brother, Raul.Similar inequity lies ahead for Iran if it sticks with its crypto strategy and, as many of us believe, bitcoin becomes a sought-after store of value in a post-COVID era of high debt, slow growth and fiat currency depreciation. Some Iranians will become phenomenally rich. Others will be stuck with worthless rials. Attempts to cross the divide will encourage corruption and social tensions. Still, for the Iranian regime, the strategy is a tempting way to fund itself. Also, given Iran’s relationship with China – with which it recently struck a $400 billion, 25-year investment deal that included access to Iranian oil and a plan for a binational “bank” – it presents an opportunity to shift the geopolitical landscape. China has the largest bitcoin mining industry in the world, and so it’s not hard to imagine Chinese bitcoin miners building officially endorsed, fossil fuel-run facilities inside Iran. Once bilateral payment agreements are in place to use digital currencies that bypass the U.S.-led global financial system, one can foresee a feedback loop in which China gets oil, Iran gets hard currency, the dollar’s power is diminished, and bitcoin’s carbon footprint grows. How should the U.S. respond?My fear is the rallying cry in Congress will be that bitcoin is “enabling” reprehensible sanctions-busting behavior, prompting calls for tougher crypto regulations. That will only drive more activity underground and encourage more dirty fuel installations in Iran and elsewhere –  in effect, strengthening the regime’s hand. The alternative is the U.S. government takes a more constructive approach, encouraging innovation and economic freedom. It could offer to work with domestic bitcoin miners to commit to zero greenhouse emissions and, in so doing, develop such energy sources, whether it’s the government’s nuclear plants or locally run solar and wind operations. As I wrote in a prior newsletter, I see a pathway for government incentives to make bitcoin mining a catalyst for green energy development. Iran, as an energy powerhouse, is well placed to work with U.S. scientists on such solutions. One can hope, right?With “Saturday Night Live” making skits about NFTs, multiple sports stars and celebrities minting them and digital art selling for nosebleed prices, it seems like a good time to check in on how the NFT market has responded to all this attention. Thankfully, the latest quarterly report from ConsenSys on the state of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Ethereum contains a nice set of pie charts to tell the story:As expected, sales of crypto art grew rapidly during the quarter as a mania for non-fungible tokens took hold. However, the spoils of the growing pie were not distributed evenly. Nifty Gateway, the NFT platform acquired by Gemini two years ago, has consistently gobbled up the biggest piece of it.Why? In one word: Beeple. The March $69 million sale of the digital artist’s ""Everydays – The First Five Thousand Days"" digital collage was not only a major driver of the platform’s volume, it also reflected the established relationship Beeple had already built with Christie’s, Nifty Gateway and other sellers of high-value digital art.Herein lies an old-school journalist’s crotchety warnings about treating rumors responsibly. Crypto Twitter can take some lessons from a saga that began with a tweet early Tuesday by Alistair Milne, whose Twitter profile (89,300 followers) says he is the CIO of the Altana Digital Currency Fund.That got many, many, people excited – for obvious reasons. Bitcoin’s price did not immediately jump after the tweet, but for the 36-hour period (until the rumor turned out to be false), it brushed with its highest level for the week. Knowing the trigger-happiness of the crypto investor scene, it seems likely that Milne’s tweet, which was very widely shared, prompted many to buy. Now, before we discuss what Facebook actually announced, here’s a basic rule to which I was rightly subjected in financial newsrooms throughout my career: We could never report on potentially market-moving rumors, however interesting they might be, for the simple reason that you could cause people to unfairly lose or gain money on unsubstantiated hearsay. Rumors are prevalent in all markets, precisely because people have vested interests in the price impact they can have. The last thing you want to do as a respected news outlet with a large megaphone is to amplify the rumormonger’s message. A rumor is a prompt for a journalist to try to confirm the truth of it, not to report on it prematurely. Of course, Milne is not a journalist. But in the age of social media, and for the purposes of this discussion, it’s a distinction without a difference. He has 89,000 followers and a reputation as an early investor in the space. We all have a responsibility to our audience. Anyway...Facebook’s earnings came and went on Wednesday evening with nary a mention of “bitcoin,” “cryptocurrency,” “blockchain,” “dogecoin,” or even “libra” or, for that matter, “diem.”Some delighted in the non-eventness of it all:But others were incensed. This Twitter user summed up Crypto Twitter’s reaction quite nicely (sound on):As Milne came under attack, he stood his ground. He didn’t delete the tweet and found some lighthearted ways to laugh it off, asking whether he should delete his account and then declaring he would never tweet again until Facebook does buy bitcoin. But his mentions kept filling up. It probably didn’t help he had tweet-boasted 14 hours before the Facebook earnings release of taking profits, nor that he later defensively blamed the rumor on someone else.Here, two old-school newsroom rules are useful: 1) the problem is not that you start a rumor per se, it’s that you amplify it and in so doing legitimize it, and 2) just putting the label “rumor” on an unsubstantiated claim does not get you off the hook. You’re still amplifying it.That last tweet, 22 hours after the Facebook earnings report, suggests our culprit still has some learning to do.Still, it’s heartening to know that an angry Twitter mob can have a sobering impact. Based on this last tweet from Alistair Milne on the topic Thursday night, he might think twice next time:Bitcoin investors are hoping the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finally approves an exchange-traded fund for bitcoin, giving the price a boost. With at least three proposals before an SEC that’s now led by crypto-savvy Chairman Gary Gensler, and given the success of three Canadian ETFs, expectations are stronger than ever for a positive ruling.",2021-04-30
3725,"The next time someone smugly tells you there is “no legitimate use case” for cryptocurrency, or asserts that it has “no redeeming social value,” shove this story in his or her face:Meduza, a Russian news outlet, is soliciting donations in cryptocurrency (along with traditional payment methods) after the government labeled it a “foreign agent,” CoinDesk’s on-the-ground correspondent, Anna Baydakova, reported Thursday.Meduza is now required by law to post a notice of its “foreign agent” status in a typeface bigger than the text of its articles. As a result of this scarlet letter, Meduza lost many of its advertisers and is running out of money, the team behind the publication said. Apparently, it hasn’t been deplatformed by traditional financial institutions because it is also taking donations by bank card and PayPal. But the reasons Meduza gave for including the crypto option were telling.“If people are afraid to send us money from their bank accounts, and they might well be, they can send us crypto,” said Meduza’s editor-in-chief, Ivan Kolpakov.A skeptic might note that donors who send bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or BNB to Meduza would leave a permanent record of their actions on the blockchains, or public ledgers, of these assets. But such a record would show only the address, a random-seeming string of numbers and letters, that sent the money, not the person behind it. An address may or may not be tied to donors’ real-world identity, depending on how they acquired the crypto and what steps they took to protect their privacy, whereas their bank and PayPal accounts definitely are.Further, if recent history teaches us anything, it is that financial intermediaries cannot be relied upon to stand with dissident or unpopular voices.We saw this more than a decade ago with the blockade of WikiLeaks by PayPal and other large financial institutions that caved to extra-legal pressure from U.S. politicians.We see it today when payment processors and crowdfunding sites boot content creators, fundraisers or pariah-friendly internet platforms, not because they are breaking any laws but because their speech offends activists. I, too, find the content in many of these cases unsavory. But I don’t mind that it exists, and I don’t want to prevent those who want to read, watch or hear it from doing so. That’s a basic “small-l liberal” principle. Or was.To quote a locked Twitter account, whom I will not name out of respect for the person's privacy: “If I cover my ears because I don’t want to hear from you, it’s not censorship. If I cover your mouth or someone else’s ears because people want to hear you, it’s censorship.”I can already hear the bien pensants say, “It’s only censorship when the government does it.” But even if you accept only that narrow legal definition of the word, it surely describes what the Russian government – the very regime whose influence in the U.S. many of those same bien pensants spent the last four years hyperventilating about – is trying to do to Meduza.Crypto might thwart that attempt, or at least hinder it, by enabling individuals to transfer money to a publisher without permission from third parties that can be strong-armed or politicized.By all means, let’s talk about the copious amounts of electricity required to secure Bitcoin and other proof-of-stake networks – although describing this intensive computation as “wasteful” is a subjective value judgment. (TikTok and hair dryers are wasteful in my book. Should those things be banned?)By all means, let’s acknowledge that cryptocurrency’s openness to all comers makes it attractive to criminals – although the blockchain’s trail of crumbs also helps law enforcement catch the crooks who use these systems.See also: Daniel Kuhn – Bitcoin, Warts and AllBy all means, let’s pay attention to how terrorists, foreign or now, we’re told, domestic, might take advantage of this technology. But if we’re going to blame anyone or anything other than the terrorists for their actions, remember it was not Satoshi Nakamoto who destabilized the Middle East or hollowed out Middle America.When tallying the social costs of censorship-resistant money, do not ignore the benefits for the Meduzas of the world.",2021-04-30
3726,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices surged Friday as the market appeared largely unfazed by the expiration of more than $4 billion of options earlier in the day. Historical price patterns suggest the largest cryptocurrency may be due for further gains over the coming weeks.Since October the settlement of the monthly options contracts has proven to be a catalyst for bullish short-term moves. In the 10 days following the past six monthly expiries, the cryptocurrency has charted gains ranging from 7% to 35%.Last month, prices pulled back to $50,000 in the week leading up to the March 26 expiry, only to reverse course in the following days and reach new record highs above $64,000 on April 14. A similar dynamic unfolded before and after the February and January expiries.One possible explanation for the month-end pullbacks was that the ""max pain point"" – the strike price at which the most open options contracts expire worthless – was so far below the spot price. Such a setup raises the risk that some traders might try to push the market down so that the options would be in the money at expiration.    For instance, the max pain point for the March 26 expiry was $44,000, and the cryptocurrency traded near $60,000 a week before expiry. That likely prompted options sellers – typically institutions – to create bearish pressure in the spot/futures market and push prices closer to the max pain point in a bid to inflict maximum loss on options buyers.This time around, the max pain point for the April expiry, which took place at 08:00 UTC Friday, was $54,000, according to Deribit, the dominant exchange for trading cryptocurrency options. Prices fell from $60,000 to $48,000 in the eight days to April 25. However, the cryptocurrency bounced back over the next few days. By the time of Friday's expiration, the price was right around the max pain point of $54,000. Most options expired worthless or out of the money.

3730,"Former crypto-friendly Florida tax collector Joel Greenberg attempted to use bitcoin to pay for a presidential pardon, The Daily Beast reported Thursday. Greenberg offered to send $250,000 in the cryptocurrency to Roger Stone, a political consultant tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump, as a fee for Stone securing a pardon for Greenberg, The Daily Beast said, citing screenshots of Signal messages the former Florida official allegedly sent. “If I get you $250K in bitcoin, would that help or is this not a financial matter?” Greenberg reportedly wrote.The disclosure is part of a broader story about U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who is reportedly being investigated by federal officials for an alleged sexual relationship with a minor.Federal prosecutors have charged Greenberg with a number of legal violations, including sex trafficking of a child. Gaetz, a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, is said to be under investigation as part of Greenberg’s case, and Greenberg is cooperating with the investigation, according to the New York Times.The Daily Beast reported Thursday it had also acquired a confession letter Greenberg wrote as part of his effort to secure a pardon. The letter implicates Gaetz in the allegations of sex with a minor, according to the news site.“On more than one occasion, this individual was involved in sexual activities with several of the other girls, the congressman from Florida’s 1st Congressional District and myself,” Greenberg is reported to have penned in late 2020.Gas money, gifts, rent or partial tuition payments are among the methods Greenberg alleges he and Gaetz used, including to the individual under the age of 18, according to the article. Payments using Square's Cash App, PayPal's Venmo and other tools were made to the girls on “behalf of the congressman,” according to the report.A spokesperson for Gaetz did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday night.",2021-04-30
3731,"Jason Somensatto, a former lawyer at decentralized exchange project 0x Labs, is the new acting director of LabCFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) financial technology research division.Somensatto will take over from Melissa Netram, who departed the post in early April. Before joining the CFTC in February, he was a senior counsel at 0x, whose ZRX token was the first ERC-20 token to be listed on Coinbase’s professional trading platform. 0x raised $24 million in an initial coin offering in 2017.Somensatto declined to comment when reached, but the current LabCFTC “Team” page confirms his role.While a number of high-profile regulators have recently taken positions in crypto businesses, Somensatto is one of the individuals moving the other way this year.In a statement, Acting CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam praised Somensatto’s appointment. “I am grateful that Jason has agreed to serve as the Acting Director of LabCFTC,” he said. “Given his experience and deep knowledge of the digital asset marketplace, I am confident he will continue supporting the agency’s important role within this evolving space.”Prior to Somensatto’s tenure, LabCFTC was headed by Daniel Gorfine, the first director of the CFTC office, and Netram, who took over in October 2019.That same month, then-Chairman Heath Tarbert announced the division would be spun out into its own independent office, reporting directly to the CFTC chair. The group acts as a research division within the federal regulator, publishing primers on the crypto industry as well as “Requests for Input” on issues like Ethereum and the surrounding market.The CFTC oversees all derivatives and other commodity products in the U.S., and is the regulator responsible for green-lighting bitcoin and ether futures products. The agency is also nominally responsible for spotting potential fraud or manipulation in the markets of some other cryptocurrencies, like litecoin and dogecoin.While President Joe Biden’s nominee to head the U.S. federal securities regulator, Gary Gensler, was recently confirmed to his post by the Senate, there’s no clear picture yet of who Biden will tap to lead the CFTC on a permanent basis. ",2021-04-29
3732,"Better enforcement of cryptocurrency regulations can help address an increasing number of ransomware attacks, a public-private task force claimed Thursday.The Ransomware Task Force, led by the Institute for Security and Technology with support from Microsoft, McAfee and various government agencies, published a report proposing a host of government and company responses to the growing threat of ransomware attacks, including recommendations to disrupt payments to the developers who develop this form of malware.A ransomware attack is one where a malicious actor hijacks a computer or network, locking it until the victim pays a ransom, often in cryptocurrency (ransomware victims paid close to $350 million in crypto to attackers last year). Paying the ransom is not necessarily a guarantee the perpetrator will share a decryption tool to unlock the computer.The report recommended properly enforcing existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws to help tamp down payments made in crypto, and hinted that additional regulations may be necessary.“The cryptocurrency sector that enables ransomware crime should be more closely regulated. Governments should require cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto kiosks, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading ‘desks’ to comply with existing laws, including Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Combatting Financing of Terrorism (CFT) laws,” the report said.The report noted that this sort of regulatory enforcement would have to be international. A single nation enforcing KYC/AML laws would be insufficient, given that some companies set up shop in countries with more lax regulations.“A single country’s laws or capabilities will be insufficient to tackle this global threat,” the report said.Kemba Walden, an assistant general counsel at Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, said in a panel announcing the report that many ransomware developers want payments in bitcoin, rather than privacy coins.This is because of the low trading volumes for these privacy coins, the report said. However, while malicious actors may not be using privacy coins, the report did warn that attackers might use mixing services to obfuscate how transactions occur.Chainalysis Director of Market Development Don Spies, who is a member of the task force, told CoinDesk the group came together around the idea that the ransomware threat is likely to grow.“I think one of the main goals of this was not to propose additional, stifling measures but to help folks realize that you can actually take a stab at this with existing measures,” he said. “In the regulatory space, AML, if we just enforce existing laws on the books in a consistent manner, I think we have the ability to really combat what’s going on.”Pamela Clegg, vice president of financial investigations at CipherTrace, said in a blog post one of the goals would be to disrupt the ransomware business model, saying crypto is just one aspect of the issue.The task force received support from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Europol, with members hailing from a host of government agencies and private entities. Spies said he volunteered to join the group, and was not paid for his participation.In video remarks at the unveiling of the report, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called the report an “impressive accomplishment.”“The Department will work to implement many of your recommendations because one thing is clear: Ransomware is a threat to national security,” Mayorkas said. ",2021-04-29
3733,"Traders and analysts continue to talk up ether and alternative cryptocurrencies as bitcoin struggles to regain the $64,000 record price level attained weeks ago.The price of bitcoin was dropping Thursday, going as low as $52,622 and settling at $52,964 as of press time. There’s been an almost $3,000 price change over the past 24 hours for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, ranging from $55,851 down to $52,622.It’s the season for alternative cryptocurrencies, or “alts,” according to Rich Rosenblum, president of crypto market maker GSR. This might help explain why bitcoin has suddenly lost some of the momentum seen earlier this week. “When new money flows into BTC, people are less focused on alts,” Rosenblum told CoinDesk. “Once it feels like the bullish pattern for BTC breaks down, people roll some of those profits into alts.”The market dominance of bitcoin continues to decline, and it’s less than half of the total blockchain market Thursday. At 49.5% at press time it is down from 73% at the start of 2021. “Crypto natives might be taking profits in BTC to free up some capital to invest in alts,” Rosenblum said.Zachary Friedman, chief operating officer at quantitative firm GDA Capital, senses bitcoin’s rally might just be pausing.  “As we have seen with most bull cycles, bitcoin typically leads the charge,” Friedman said. “Once bitcoin tops, money is redistributed into altcoins, which marks the nearing end of these cycles, historically.”While ether keeps pushing to new highs almost daily, bitcoin’s all-time high above $64,400 came two weeks ago. For now, BTC is out of the limelight. “Ether and alts will likely keep up the bulk of the action for the next leg of this cycle,” Friedman said. Read More: Coinbase Debuts ‘Buy With PayPal’ Feature (but Read the Fine Print)Ether (ETH) rallied to a fresh all-time high Thursday around $2,800, before fading later in the day.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading around $2,708 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), down 0.75% over the prior 24 hours. “Since the end of March, we’ve seen ETH going stronger against BTC,” said Élie Le Rest, partner at crypto quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. The technical proposal EIP 1559 to fix the Ethereum blockchain’s problematic capacity constraints may be aiding in the bullish sentiment. “This bullish trend on ETH may be seen through different angles, but the upcoming upgrade including EIP 1559 is seen as a strong catalyst of the recent ETH bull run,” Le Rest said. Jason Lau, chief operating office of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin, said ether appears to have decoupled from bitcoin. “This is significant as ETH/BTC had been in the ~0.02-0.04 BTC range for almost the past two years, but recently just hit ~0.05 BTC” Lau said. As of press time, the ETH/BTC pair, which signals traders rotating in and out of bitcoin into and from ether, is up 2.6% and well over 0.05 BTC. It has been mega bullish since April 27. “The [non-fungible token] boom, recent scalability improvements, Ethereum protocol upgrades and DeFi growth have all contributed,” Lau said. “Those upcoming features are a great incentive for investors to tag along, contributing to ETH against BTC” Read More: As Ether Pushes Ever Higher, Crypto Traders Plot Price in Bitcoin TermsOne of the biggest gainers in the altcoin space this year is Binance coin (BNB),  an asset used to offset trading fees charged on the Binance exchange.

3734,"Meduza, one of Russia's leading independent news organizations, called for donations in fiat, bitcoin, ether and BNB after Russian authorities labeled it a “foreign agent” last week.The label, basically marking Meduza as an “enemy of the state,” can hurt its ability to contact sources and report news, the team said in a statement. “They are trying to kill Meduza,” the team said in another editorial statement. “The Ministry of Justice deemed us a ‘foreign agent.’ As a result, we lost our advertisers. It means that our funds are running out. Right now.” On April 23, the Russian Justice Ministry designated Meduza as a foreign agent, which means the journalists will have to mark every article they write as published by a foreign agent. They will also have to submit detailed financial reports every quarter. According to the editor-in-chief, Ivan Kolpakov, on Monday many advertisers pulled out. Because of the financial urgency, Meduza launched a fundraiser on Thursday, asking donors to send money via a bank card payment, PayPal or crypto transfers in bitcoin, ether and BNB.Meduza joins a small number of Russian organizations that accept donations in crypto, including one led by prominent politician Alexey Navalny as well as several human rights-related groups. Read more: Russian Activists Use Bitcoin, and the Kremlin Doesn’t Like It“If people are afraid to send us money from their bank accounts, and they might well be, they can send us crypto,” Kolpakov said, adding: Read also: Facial Recognition Tech May Be Being Used Against Russian ProtestorsKolpakov added that the list of cryptocurrencies will be expanded. For now, they chose  bitcoin and ether because they are the most popular, and BNB because it has the cheapest transaction fees. The team is also thinking of issuing and selling non-fungible tokens (NFT) to raise funds, Kolpakov said.“If it was up to me, I would take all the donations in crypto,” Kolpakov said. “We believe in crypto and blockchain, we believe it’s the future of global finance. Plus, for many years, our readers have been asking for an option to donate crypto.”The donations have been flowing in. In the initial hours following the announcement of the fundraiser, Meduza received dozens of small donations, over 0.29 BTC and 3 ETH in total (or more than $23,800). Meduza will contest the “foreign agent” status in court but the chances of winning are slim, Kolpakov said. So for now, the team is trying to buy some time and decide what to do next. “Among other things, we’re going to see if we can live off donations,” he added.Meduza’s troubles are part of a larger trend of recent police actions against journalists in Russia. On April 9, the police raided the apartment of a prominent investigative journalist Roman Anin. On April 17, Anin’s colleague, Ekaterina Arenina, was detained after interviewing people for her story about torture in Russian prisons. Over the past weekend, police also detained several journalists who reported on protest rallies against the imprisonment of the politician Alexey Navalny, who was demanding medical help while in prison. Student magazine editors were placed under house arrest last year.In December, several individual journalists were branded as foreign agents by the state. Last July, former prominent defense reporter Ivan Safronov went to jail on treason charges. Meduza is an online news outlet that provides news in Russian and English. It was founded by the core team of another Russian media outlet, Lenta.ru, in 2014, after editor-in-chief Galina Timchenko was fired by the owner for Lenta’s coverage of Ukraine’s 2014 revolution. Many journalists left the publication in protest. When Timchenko and two other editors founded Meduza, some of those journalists joined the startup. The team has been operating from an office in Riga, Latvia, which is a short flight from Moscow. Core reporters are still based in Russia. Meduza has joined the list of designated foreign media agents that includes Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as well as several journalists.Meduza must now publish a notice of foreign agent status in a larger font than the main text of its articles. This week, Meduza started adding such notices at the top of every article and tweet, typing it in all capital letters on Twitter. The law on foreign agents was passed in 2012, defining a foreign agent as an organization that is involved in political activities and receiving funding from abroad. However, there was no precise definition of political activity. Currently, 75 nonprofits in Russia, including human rights, election monitoring and educational groups, have this status.Read more: Bitcoin Dissidents: Those Who Need It MostIn December, the law was amended so that individuals can also be designated foreign agents. Immediately after that, five journalists and civil rights activists were deemed foreign agents. “For years, Russian authorities have used the ‘foreign agents’ law to suppress independent groups,” Human Right Watch wrote in 2020. ",2021-04-29

3736,"China’s capital, Beijing, is probing cryptocurrency mining operations to assess their impact on energy consumption, Reuters reported Thursday. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology sent out an emergency notice to the city’s data centers on Tuesday asking them to report any involvement in crypto mining operations, according to a document obtained by Reuters.Data centers are required to report the amount and share of power used up by the mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the notice said. The probe was directed by city authorities, and recipients of the notice included the country’s three largest telecommunications operators, an official of the bureau told Reuters.Crypto mining has recently come under fire for consuming large amounts of energy. A number of mining hubs including Iran, Abkhazia and now China have started cracking down on crypto mining operations over energy concerns.In March, Inner Mongolia, an autonomous region in China, declared it would force crypto mining businesses to close by April.  Despite China’s ban on crypto exchanges, the country remains a mining hub, contributing up to 65% of the global mining hashrate (the computing power used to mine cryptocurrencies). After a series of accidents in Southern China’s coal mines, resulting power outages caused the global bitcoin hashrate to drop dramatically, as miners in the region rely on cheap energy from coal.",2021-04-29
3737,"As the Coinbase public listing approached, many analysts were looking for a $100 billion valuation. The cryptocurrency exchange, founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, hit that mark briefly after listing, but COIN has settled down to a less-rarified valuation. Meanwhile, CoinGecko calculates a total market capitalization of $128 billion for decentralized finance (DeFi), the corner of the cryptocurrency industry that represents a wide range of lending, trading and betting activities carried out almost entirely on blockchain networks using tokens as proceeds and collateral. The top five tokens on CoinGecko's list are UNI, LINK, LUNA, AAVE and CAKE. The following chart is from a CoinGecko page that tracks the combined market cap of all DeFi tokens:Coinbase, it should be noted, listed DeFi as a potential competitor when it filed for a public listing, but for whatever reason, market caps aren't how we usually talk about the DeFi market. We usually talk about the value of assets people have deposited in DeFi apps to earn yield.But that measure gives a similar reading: There is now more than $100 billion worth of assets locked up in DeFi. These get to be very large numbers, numbers that are worth reviewing to illuminate a story that somehow continues to be missed even as cryptocurrency has started going mainstream.Here at CoinDesk we have focused on DeFi on Ethereum because DeFi originated on Ethereum, and it is where the best-known entrepreneurs have committed to operating.Those aforementioned deposited assets are referred to as total value locked (TVL). TVL on Ethereum, using the most widely cited data site, DeFi Pulse, is $66 billion as of this writing, more than quadrupling since Jan. 1 when it was $15 billion.Meanwhile, DeFi has taken off in a big way on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). According to Defistation, the current TVL on there is $38 billion, led by PancakeSwap but also including money markets filling a similar role to Aave and derivative solutions that fill a similar role to dydx.  DeFi on BSC has grown much faster than on Ethereum; it first hit $1 billion in TVL only at the end of January.Here's a chart that compares funds entrusted to Ethereum's many DeFi smart contracts in the last year or so to funds that went to founders in initial coin offerings during the 2017-2018 boom (an updated version of one published here):It should be noted that DeFi Pulse was in the midst of updating how it tracks the TVL for the robo-adviser for yield, Yearn Finance, when this was made, and so those numbers aren't in this graph. According to Yearn itself, though, it has had several billion dollars tied up.Read more: DeFi reshapes the CoinDesk 20While the 2020 surge was known as ""DeFi Summer,"" it's already evident the market is much bigger now.For example, TVL first broke $1 billion in February 2020. It broke $10 billion in September, on Ethereum. Earlier this month, the money market platform Compound broke $10 billion in TVL all on its own.Tuesday night, the original DeFi protocol, stablecoin minter MakerDAO, also broke $10 billion for the first time. Richard Chen, at the venture firm 1confirmation, has been assembling on-chain data about users using Dune Analytics. One chart is worth citing here in particular.This shows there are at least 2 million wallets that have interacted with DeFi protocols. So that probably means something like more than a million individuals, maybe even close to two? It's very hard to say, but it is also worth noting that sometimes individuals participate in DeFi via third parties. So while some users hold many wallets, it's also true that some wallets represent many users.Whatever the real count of users, the amount of money changing hands shows these applications are real businesses. The site Crypto Fees has been tracking usage fees charged on different DeFi applications. The top DeFi applications it lists (Uniswap, SushiSwap and Compound) show a seven-day average of daily fees collected ranging from $1 million to $4 million. If there's one kind of finance that everyone understands, it is lending. The blockchain software company ConsenSys just released a first-quarter report on DeFi on Ethereum, showing a growing market for loans:DeFi represents a much more credible narrative with more substantive businesses because it shows products with genuine returns and provides a way for people to earn impressive yields on deposits rather than making wild bets and hoping. Wild bets are the best way to describe much (though certainly not all) of the investing that took place in the initial coin offering boom of 2017 to 2018. That boom drove the prior bull run, and the public appeared capable of making that connection. Four years later, the cryptocurrency industry is in a bull run again, but the public appears incapable of connecting it to these billion-dollar deposits into this new iteration on finance. For whatever reason, the main topics are, again, bitcoin's price and, somehow, non-fungible tokens and dogecoin.",2021-04-29

After that, Ethereum founder Vitalik Butrin plans to implement a ""sharding"" upgrade in a bid to expand Ethereum's capacity to process transactions by splitting its database into 64 mini-blockchains. That may bring down transaction fees, bringing more network activity and stronger demand for ether.While the path of least resistance for ETH/BTC appears to be on the higher side, it may not be smooth sailing, said Stack Funds' head of research, Lennard Neo.""The breakout seen on the weekly chart is quite significant as the next resistance dates back to May 2018 at the 0.09 value,"" Neo said.

3742,"The story of boring bitcoin and exciting ether continued in the cryptocurrency markets Wednesday.Bitcoin’s price was holding steady on Wednesday, showing little change over the past 24 hours. At around 02:30 UTC (9 p.m. ET Tuesday), the world’s largest cryptocurrency went as high as $55,710. It then lost steam and returned to the $54,000 level but was at $54,925 as of press time. Over-the-counter crypto trader Alessandro Andreotti says bitcoin’s stagnant market is due to investors continuing to explore other cryptocurrencies. ”Bitcoin has, in fact, gone up, but I see it as a consolidation move to a new price range,” Andreotti said. “It's staying relatively stable right now while alts moon.”Alternative cryptocurrencies, or “alts,” are certainly shining. Bitcoin’s dominance, a measure of its share of cryptocurrency market capitalization, has dropped over 16% to 50.45% since the start of April, according to calculations by charting provider TradingView. “You can see bitcoin dominance has been steadily decreasing over the last day and week,” added Andreotti. “Overall, the crypto market is behaving in a very similar way to the 2017 run. If it keeps doing that, we can expect a new run for bitcoin in the short to mid term, possibly a new all-time high even, while alts consolidate at their new price ranges.”In the derivatives space, open interest in bitcoin futures across major venues is way down so far this week. Last week, the total open interest hit $523 billion. So far this week, that number is a paltry $124 billion, according to data aggregator Skew.As the bitcoin boredom continues, the crypto ecosystem has excitement in the form of ether and decentralized finance, or DeFi, according to Rich Rosenblum, president of cryptocurrency market maker GSR. “As the space matures, we'll see more dispersion,” Rosenblum told CoinDesk. “BTC is increasingly a proxy for traditional finance coming to the space via regulated platforms, while ether is more of the crypto natives buying ETH directly or indirectly as a result of DeFi.”David Streltsoff, chief revenue officer for quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, says the lack of BTC market action might simply be newer investors looking elsewhere for quick profits given the low returns bitcoin is putting out. “I don't think bitcoin has lost its luster,” Streltsoff said. “Investors, at least in retail, are looking for the next DOGE and a mere 20% isn't good enough anymore.” Read More: Bitcoin’s Recovery Rally Stalls as Fed Meeting Draws to a CloseBitcoin is down over 6% so far in April, according to spot data from Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp. “BTC holding support of around $54,000 is positive,” Streltsoff added. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $2,723 and climbing 3.9% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). ETH has hit a new all-time high, with the record now standing at $2,743, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The highest day for ether spot volumes in 2021 occurred last week, hitting $68 billion across major exchanges April 23, according to CoinDesk Research data. Bitcoin’s volumes that day were $88 billion, signalling ether is gaining some momentum on the world’s oldest cryptocurrency. Total value locked in the Ethereum ecosystem has crossed $64 billion for the first time, a fresh high as investors plow more money into DeFi.“Ether prices follow total value locked,” said GSR’s Rosenblum. “ETH is much more correlated to DeFi even though BTC is technically DeFi, too.” As of press time, 9.9 million ETH is locked in DeFi, worth over $27.1 billion. Meanwhile, 155,748 BTC, worth $8.5 billion, is parked in various DeFi apps.Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading for crypto liquidity provider Blockfills, says ether’s infrastructure is a key reason traders are steadfastly interested in buying ether over bitcoin for the time being. “I just think the overall landscape for ether has improved greatly,” Van Huis told CoinDesk. The Ethereum blockchain ""shook off the [initial coin offering] boom and bust, went through several bull/bear markets and the infrastructure has finally been laid for ETH to do what it was, hopefully, intended to do.”Read More: Bumper, a DeFi-Based Crypto Volatility Protection Plan, Raises $10MDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Wednesday.

""We’re sticking to our view that tapering will start at the end of this year, with the first rate hikes in the second half of next year Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a report published on Wednesday. ""We now think the Fed will start to discuss tapering over the summer but the actual taper probably still won’t happen until the turn of the year,"" wrote Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, in an email.An uneventful Fed meeting opens the door for the continuation of a risk-on environment, where investors are more willing to enter into higher-return, higher-risk investments from stocks to bitcoin, wrote Deutsche Bank in a report published on Tuesday. Looser monetary policy can also be negative for the U.S. dollar because lower U.S. interest rates tend to diminish the appeal of Treasury bonds and other dollar-denominated assets.   ",2021-04-28
3744,"A Binance Smart Chain Uniswap clone, Uranium Finance, lost $50 million in tokens early Wednesday morning in an exploit.The attacker took advantage of a vulnerability that has been present in Uranium's v2 contracts since the exchange upgraded over a week ago. After sending the minimum required tokens into Uranium's ""pair contracts,"" the attacker drained the liquidity pools for multiple token pairs; a misplaced zero in the contract's balance field (or rather, the lack of one in a section that manages reserves) created the opening for the attack vector.Out of the $50 million filched, pools for Binance's blockchain token (BNB) and its stablecoin (BUSD) each lost $18 million in funds. Ethereum and BTCB pools (Binance Chain's version of ""wrapped'' bitcoin) collectively lost around $9 million worth of tokens. An additional $6.7 million in USDT and $1.7 million in DOT, ADA and Uranium's own token also disappeared from other pools. Post-hack, the BTCB has been swapped for real BTC, and the ETH is in an Ethereum mixer called Tornado Cash, according to The Block researcher Igor Igamberdiev. Notably, per a past exploit on Binance's BSC blockchain, the BNB and BUSD could be recovered through a rollback, though Binance has made no announcements on the matter.This vulnerability is present in all Uranium v2 pools. A Telegram pinned message by anonymous Uranium community member Baymax warns users to ""STOP adding liquidity ... and remove liquidity if you can"" because the exploit still leaves millions of dollars in tokens at risk in these v2 contracts.Baymax advises users to migrate to the v2.1 contracts, which include a fix for the vulnerability. Notably, the attack came two hours before v2.1 went live, even though the exploit had been open since Uranium's last upgrade to v2 just over a week ago.""As you all know, we commissioned an audit, and among the finding was an issue of low severity. Devs dug deeper and found an issue that had the whole farm at risk,” Baymax's pinned message reads. ""There are a total of 7 people in Uranium who knew of the exploit. Outside of Uranium would be the 3 auditors contractors and their respective sub cons who may be aware of this flaw,"" it reads farther down. Later in the message, Baymax hypothesizes that ""someone leaked information"" that lead to the attacker exploiting the vulnerability. Baymax did not respond to follow-up questions regarding the auditor of Uranium’s code.Baymax also denied any involvement with Uranium beyond being a ""community member"" when speaking with CoinDesk. No other ""community members,"" whether part of Uranium's core team or otherwise, responded by press time.",2021-04-28
3745,"Reinventing money, the financial system, the internet and the enterprise is fun. But sometimes the workload can take its toll.I was reminded of that yesterday reading Dan Kuhn’s interview with Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, a hot Ethereum-scaling startup. Nailwal, who lives in India, described a grueling routine of 16 or 17 calls a day, little sleep and no vacation, even for Christmas.“My life is always spending. Personal life gets affected a lot. And this is not only for me,” he said. “Everybody who is doing anything significant in crypto is going through the same situation.”To crypto outsiders, the response to this may be some version of cry me a river. Polygon’s own token, matic, is up 35-fold this year. And anyone who invested in bitcoin (BTC) more than a few weeks ago is sitting on impressive gains, perhaps even life-changing fortunes. A little hard work is worth it.But there are reasons why working in crypto comes with special strains and why Nailwal says, “There will be studies on mental health on the people in crypto.” The market is 24/7. Volatility is baked in. And any successful project has lots of stakeholders who need looking after. That’s the nature of these decentralized, commonly owned, commonly governed initiatives.Nailwal spoke of running a startup that faces the scrutiny of a listed company.“When you are building your own token startup, basically you are a public company, you have similar obligations as being a public company because everything is on view. Plus, you have to handle all of the pressure of being a startup. You have to build your product, find your customers and all that. The pressure is multifold.""You are working in the finance industry and you are working in a startup – both are extremely excruciating things, but together in one job. It has been very taxing. On a personal level and professional level I feel like I have aged a lot.”Marc Hochstein and I recently interviewed a psychotherapist in Southern California about crypto’s hidden mental health issues (full write-up coming soon). She has several clients who are at their wits' end, unable to cope with the dual challenges of pandemic work and an always-on industry.“This is really different. If you are in middle management in any other industry, you're not experiencing so many highs and lows. It's very intensely stressful yet exciting. But because it's new, we still don't even know what the impacts of mental health are on for those individuals in this industry.”There’s a lot more to say here. But, for now, the takeaways are these:One, look after yourself. Jeff Wilser wrote an easy 15-point guide to staying sane while trading crypto here.Two, look out for your work colleagues; they may be less happy than their emojis and Slack comments suggest.And three, if you are a manager, think about ways to offer extra help and time off, and even in-house counseling. The therapist we spoke to said the crypto industry can lead the way on mental health in the workplace, ending stigmas for good.“In my opinion, I think the whole stigma to mental health is kind of disappearing,"" she said. ""And I'm hoping that, with the new crypto industry, mental health can grow with it.”",2021-04-28
3746,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pushed back making a decision on VanEck’s proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to at least June.The securities regulator announced Wednesday it was designating a longer deliberative period for the bitcoin ETF application, saying it needed to ensure it has “sufficient time” to evaluate the proposal. There are 10 active bitcoin ETF applications, including VanEck's, and the agency is currently looking at three of them.A bitcoin ETF could be key for mainstream adoption because it would be a regulated product allowing financial institutions and retail traders to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to invest in it directly.“The Commission designates June 17, 2021, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change,” states the filing, signed by Assistant Secretary J. Matthew DeLesDernier.The SEC can take up to 240 days to determine whether it will approve or disapprove the ETF application. To date the agency has taken the full 240 days for most of the bitcoin ETF applications it has considered, and then rejected every application. Proponents believe 2021 may finally be the year a bitcoin ETF is approved in the U.S., citing the launch of several such products in Canada and the recent confirmation of apparently crypto-friendly regulator Gary Gensler as the chair of the SEC.VanEck filed its ETF proposal at the end of 2020, with Cboe BZX filing a 19b-4 form formally announcing its intention to act as VanEck’s exchange partner earlier this year. The SEC is also looking at Kryptoin and WisdomTree’s bitcoin ETF applications.

3748,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recovery rally has paused as the closely watched two-day Federal Reserve meeting wraps up Wednesday afternoon. The leading cryptocurrency is trading back and forth in the $53,900 to $55,700 range, having charted an impressive bounce from roughly $48,000 over the previous two days. The market is struggling to find direction, possibly due to caution ahead of the end of the Fed gathering. Investors will be waiting for the post-meeting statement and to see during the post-meeting press conference if Chairman Jerome Powell drops hints of an early scaling back of stimulus because of fears of mounting inflation. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows inflation expectations for the second half of the current decade reached a 30-month high of 2.25% on Tuesday. Inflation fears have also spread to the stock market and could soon translate into a higher consumer price index, as per a new report from Bank of America. Bitcoin may face selling pressure if the Fed turns hawkish (inclined to raise rates) and signals an early tapering of stimulus. ""A tightening stance from the Fed might cause bitcoin to give away the weekly gains,"" Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange, said. The Fed has been buying $120 billion worth of bonds under its open-ended asset purchase program since March 2020 to thwart the coronavirus pandemic's negative impact on markets and the economy. The central bank's benchmark interest rate also stands at a record low of 0.25%. Financial assets and bitcoin have been significant beneficiaries of this ultra-easy monetary policy. Hence hints of early reversal may bring about a correction in asset prices. That said, analysts expect the Fed to maintain its easing (dovish) bias. ""Rather than follow the lead of the Bank of Canada [BOC], which last week began cutting back on bond purchases and signaled a quicker time frame for the next interest rate increase, the Fed will most likely take an approach similar to the one the European Central Bank conveyed last Thursday. ""It will maintain the policy as is, remind markets that it is willing to do even more should downside risks materialize,"" Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, noted in his Bloomberg column. LMAX Digital's Joel Kruger and Delta Exchange's Balani also foresee the Fed keeping its dovish stance intact. ""The Fed should continue with its accommodative stance despite transitory inflationary pressures,"" Balani said. Recent weakness in the dollar index and Treasury yields also points to a low probability of the Fed following BOC's footsteps. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has dropped by 2.3% this month despite signs the U.S. economy is accelerating. The 10-year Treasury yield has shed 12 basis points, according to data source TradingView. Bitcoin's recovery rally may pick up steam if the Fed maintains its easy-money policy, as is expected. ""We don't believe there will be any messaging concerning an earlier taper, and we think bitcoin will continue to be supported in this backdrop,"" Kruger said. Also read: As Powell Heads to Fed Meeting, Inflation Data Can Only Get WorseHowever, Stack Funds' Matthew Dibb said he expects price consolidation even if the Fed maintains its current course. ""From a technical view, bitcoin is lagging in its recovery since last week, with the majority of alternative cryptocurrencies charting stronger rallies,"" Dibb said. ""We caution traders that we may be stuck in the $50,000 to $60,000 range for the next few weeks.""",2021-04-28

Along with Core Scientific, miners such as Marathon, Riot, Blockcap and Gryphon have expanded their operations this year.Turner doesn’t expect the trend to stop soon given the interest from new, high-net worth players in the industry.“We do expect this trend to continue as we’re witnessing an increasing number of publicly traded companies, large family offices and hedge funds looking for enterprise-grade, trustworthy and credible mining operations in North America.

3750,"Ether has cannibalized bitcoin in Genesis’ loan book as more hedge funds borrow ETH to deploy into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, the cryptocurrency lender reported in its Q1 results on Wednesday.ETH loans at Genesis, which is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, increased by 400% from $465 million in Q4 2020 to $2.4 billion in Q1. ETH now makes up 27% of the lender’s loan book, whereas its portion was just 15.5% of the loan book in Q4. Meanwhile ETH locked in DeFi overall has increased from $15 billion to $60 billion, a 300% increase. “It shows just how much institutions are taking DeFi seriously,” said Momin Ahmad, chief strategy officer at crypto credit data company Credmark. “It’s kind of hard in DeFi to figure out who’s doing what.” The lender originated 163% more loans in the first quarter than it did in the previous quarter. Its total loans outstanding now amount to $9 billion, a 136% increase from the $3.8 billion in loans outstanding the firm held in Q4. Genesis did note a decrease in BTC lent out in Q1 compared to other quarters because traders have now lost the arbitrage opportunity of selling bitcoin at a premium in the public market after a vesting period in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which is now trading at a discount. (Grayscale is also owned by Digital Currency Group.)In response to this “lackluster demand,” Genesis lowered its annual rates on borrowed BTC from depositors from 3% to 6% to between 1% to 3%. “A small percentage of our overall loan portfolio was financing the GBTC premium arb,” said Matt Ballensweig, Genesis’ vice president of lending. “The trades we did finance were with some of our best and largest counterparties who posted collateral either in the form of cash, crypto, private placement shares or a mix of these.”U.S. dollars (USD) and stablecoins maintained roughly a 21% share of the loan book because demand for cash has been “relentless,” Genesis said in its release.The lender also described a “cash-deficit issue” as a reason for crypto-backed cash loan demand. This past month, Silvergate Bank reported a 52% increase in bitcoin-backed loans since last quarter, and Signature noted that bitcoin-backed loans would begin to show up in its earnings later in 2021. “Genesis is actively looking to partner with banks such as Silvergate, Signature and investment banks to bring more cash to traders in the crypto market as yield opportunities on USD remain very attractive relative to other credit opportunities,” Ballensweig said.Genesis’ spot volume increased by 287% from $8.1 billion in Q4 to $31.5 billion in Q1, bolstered in part by Genesis Treasury, a new service at Genesis that helps corporates accumulate bitcoin through various strategies. Derivatives trading increased by 133% to $10.5 billion in Q1. “Although we grew our counterparty base by 21% over the quarter, our most significant drivers of growth were higher frequencies of trades and increased notional per trade from our crypto-native hedge fund client base,” Genesis said. “These clients were early adopters of our platform and were well positioned to take advantage of the [over-the-counter] liquidity we provided to take short-term, tactical bets in option format.”",2021-04-28

3754,"U.S. officials have arrested the alleged operator of a bitcoin mixing service on allegations of laundering nearly $336 million in bitcoin over 10 years. According to public court documents, federal agents arrested Roman Sterlingov, a Russian and Swedish citizen, on three charges stemming from his alleged involvement with bitcoin mixing service Bitcoin Fog: unlicensed money transmission, money laundering and money transmission without a license.While the U.S. government hasn't gone after many bitcoin mixing services before, prosecutors have called such services ""a crime"" in the past.Bitcoin Fog allows its customers to transfer bitcoin to each other while obfuscating where the coins are being sent from, according to an affidavit filed by Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Special Agent Devon Beckett. The service was launched in 2011 and has allegedly been used to transfer some 1.2 million BTC ($335.8 million based on their value when the transactions occurred). Customers apparently sent bitcoin from Silk Road, Evolution, AlphaBay, Agora and Silk Road 2.0.Bitcoin stolen from exchanges through hacks also went through Bitcoin Fog, the affidavit claimed. However, Bitcoin Fog is not a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network-registered money services business, and was not licensed to operate within Washington, D.C..Federal agents used blockchain analysis to determine the 1.2 million figure, as well as some of the sources for these funds, the document said.""While the identity of a Bitcoin address owner is generally anonymous (unless the owner opts to make the information publicly available), law enforcement can often identify the owner of a particular Bitcoin address by analyzing the blockchain,"" Beckett said in his affidavit. An IRS agent conducted a transaction on Bitcoin Fog, finding that it was a successful mixing service. A second transaction that the IRS agent claimed was from a narcotics sale was also sent through the service.""Analysis of bitcoin transactions, financial records, Internet service provider records, email records and additional investigative information, identifies Roman Sterlingov as the principal operator of Bitcoin Fog,"" Beckett said.Investigators also allegedly tied Sterlingov to the Bitcoin Fog domain, using a payment made through Liberty Reserve.

3756,"Crypto is a midwife for the next generation of finance: A simple set of tools built around a core idea of removing trusted intermediaries could form the foundation for a more secure, robust and innovative economy. Ethereum aims to be “the ultimate, fundamental settlement layer of this” new digital-first world, as Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of ETH scaling solution Polygon, said.Polygon, which was founded in India, itself was reborn this past year. Founded as the Matic Network in 2017, it was an early secondary layer to the Ethereum blockchain. It used an experimental solution called Plasma to shift transactions off the perennially clogged Ethereum base layer to a super-lightweight rail running parallel to it. “We were among the top Plasma teams in 2018, then the industry hype moved somewhere else,” Nailwal said in an interview. “It keeps on moving.” The Polygon team is now focused on building something of a scaling-solution aggregator for Ethereum. Instead of focusing on just one scaling technique, Polygon wants to incorporate them all.Ethereum has been a victim of its own success. It’s the most used decentralized application blockchain, with the largest developer community. It is frequently the source of some of crypto’s most innovative and popular trends. But the project can’t scale. In order to disrupt legacy finance, crypto developers have become obsessed with hacking Ethereum – with layer 2s, sidechains and, the most ambitious blockchain upgrade to date, Ethereum 2.0. See also: Matic Network Now ‘Polygon’ as Platform Targets Ethereum’s L2 WoesFor a while, Plasma was the hot topic when discussing Ethereum’s chokepoints. It was the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-creator, and Joseph Poon, a co-founder of Bitcoin scaling startup Lightning Labs. They wrote a coolly worded white paper describing a framework with plenty of upside and “without significant limitations.” Published during the 2017 supercycle – a period of hyperbolic growth during which Ethereum’s inability to scale couldn't be ignored – Plasma was soon billed as a way for Ethereum to match Visa’s transaction count (the yardstick for all blockchains, for some reason). In practice, Plasma may have had more significant limitations than advertised or expected. Although Matic found early success – Nailwal said they counted about 150 live protocols or applications before deciding to rebrand as Polygon – people’s attention began to shift elsewhere.Other scaling solutions hit the market (or were proposed), and talk of Ethereum 2.0, a complete overhaul to the Ethereum blockchain, began to pick up. Instead of resisting this changing landscape, Polygon has decided to embrace it. This decision has paid off. Amid a booming market cycle, MATIC, the network's native token is soaring. It’s a small vindication today for a project that will never be complete.Over a late-night (for him) Zoom call, Nailwal and I discussed why his team decided to expand the scope of Matic’s original vision, what that work entails and when, if ever, the project of reinventing finance will be finished. See also: Buterin, Srinivasan Donate to COVID Relief Fund for India ‘Shaken’ by Second WaveThe following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.What was the drive to reinvent Polygon? So, basically, with Matic Network we were doing one particular scaling approach, which was Plasma. We were onboarding hundreds of dapps, working with small DeFi (decentralized finance) builders, NFT (non-fungible token) application builders, games, enterprises – a large number of teams – when we realized there was no one solution-fits-all. Secondly, we also definitely believe that Ethereum is going to be the ultimate, fundamental settlement layer of this Web3 internet. So instead of providing one type of scaling solution on top of Ethereum, we should provide a suite of scalability solutions for developers to choose what they really want. If you take AWS (Amazon Web Services), they allow developers to choose between Linux, Windows, other kinds of servers. You’re free to choose. We wanted to do the same for decentralized, execution platforms. We’re doing Optimistic Rollups, zk-rollups, data-availability chains, Polkadot-like substrates, standalone chains where teams can come and create their parachains that connect back to Ethereum. Why are you choosing one blockchain to focus on, but multiple scaling solutions? There are multiple aspects: First, Ethereum has network effects. We do a lot of hackathons, like 100 a year. 99.999% of all the developers we meet are breaking into blockchain development, and almost always, the first blockchain they work with is Ethereum. Once you come into Ethereum, the community, with its documentation, tooling, you kind of feel like a part of it. All these newbies fall in love. These days, funding is available in plenty, so they’re most likely to stay to build products. Second, the ethos of the Ethereum community. Think of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the way it is because Satoshi built it that way, and at a very early stage anonymized himself. No normal leader would do that. Although Ethereum does have Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation, who are still the biggest figures, the way they’ve been able to cultivate this fully decentralized community without dictating anything. As a person coming in, you feel as though you can propose any change to Ethereum, without taking orders from anyone. No one owns Ethereum. Now with layer 2, scalability is coming. That makes it difficult for me to understand how any other blockchain will, first, be able to get the same network effects and, second, how they will be able to cultivate an ethos, which depends on the OGs. Many competing chains are VC-driven. Network effects and community are intangible things you cannot buy with money. You have to do the grind. See also: Andrew Keys – 16 Ethereum Predictions From a Crypto OracleThen, Ethereum is not slowing down. If you compare 2020 to 2017, Ethereum has this DeFi wave. Previously, it had the ICO (initial coin offering) wave. Then you have NFT waves, there were DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in between. These waves keep on coming, innovation keeps on coming. Do you see any particularly innovative product coming out of these other chains? I do not recall any project that was not already done on Ethereum. How much of Matic are you keeping in Polygon? Some people think that it’s a rebrand, that it’s a pivot. But actually, it’s an expansion. Matic stays the way it is. Think of it as a Venn diagram. Matic is a smaller circle within Polygon, while Polygon’s scope and vision has become much bigger. Polygon is now just launching. Matic has already launched. When do you expect to go fully live?Polygon, actually, technically will never be fully live. Because it is a layer 2 aggregator, and there will always be new solutions. There are multiple mainnets expected. You have this current Poly Plasma, and PoS, and data availability. Later this year you might have Optimistic rollups going live, Zk-Rollups going live. These solutions will keep on coming and getting consolidated in Polygon. That’s a lot of specialized knowledge – does the Polygon team have to grow exponentially if the platform is, too?That’s absolutely a valid question. The team has grown aggressively. The way we’ve built the Polygon ecosystem, we’ve never had a foundation or sold too many tokens. We’re holding tokens – maybe up to a billion dollars in treasury assets – and we intend to spend that money to grow this ecosystem. We already have people in Serbia, in Eastern Europe, building SDK (software development kits). We have a specialized team in India building data availability. Our previous team, the network team. We’re also collaborating with other specialized teams. These will be multiple, decentralized teams all working for scaling Ethereum. You’re building failure into the model. You’re willing to spend capital to build solutions that may not take off or fail, with the idea that it’s an ever growing, expanding universe.That’s a nice articulation: We’re building failure into the model. The fundamental goal of Polygon is to not go all in on one particular approach. We learned that the hard way. We were among the top Plasma teams in 2018, then the industry hype moved somewhere else. It keeps on moving. We faced the brunt of that and decided we don’t want to be too specific. We want to be a multi-approach solution and provide these solutions to see which one picks up. The vision is adoption. We see where that adoption is and go deep on that. Ultimately, it’s a community thing. If one type of solution is adopted, automatically, we’ll start to provide support. Doesn’t Eth 2.0, an Ethereum that can scale on its own, reduce the need for Polygon?Ethereum 2.0 is supposed to have 64 shards, each one is going to be similar to what Ethereum is today. Let’s say after you add proof-of-stake to the current, single Ethereum chain, it’s able to process 50 tps (transactions per second), up from 13 tps today. Multiply that 64 shards: 3,200 tps. Do you think if Ethereum is going to become the fundamental settlement layer of the world that even 3,200 tps is a good enough scalability? No, absolutely not. Let’s think of it as the supply of scalability. At the moment it goes up on Ethereum, the demand is already there. It will grow immediately and you will end up with the same bottlenecks. That’s why Vitalik published a layer 2-centric roadmap for Ethereum, where he says ETH2.0 will only have data availability shards, meaning they will only have the data of the applications, but the execution happens on layer 2. Ethereum 2.0 will become 64 times more scalable than Ethereum is now, but the demand is 1,000 X than where we are. You will need L2 scalability. Polygon is often discussed alongside Polkadot and Cosmos. Are there plans for greater blockchain interoperability?We are interoperable, but within Ethereum. A good mental model is to think of Polkadot as being in the center of a nest of parachains. With Polygon, the Ethereum chain is in the center with an array of Polygon chains around it. That’s why some people call it ‘Polkadot on Ethereum.’ It is interoperable between scaling solutions. Some people are building bridges to Binance Chain or Bitcoin, but at the foundation we are solely focused on Ethereum. Every week there is a DeFi hack. Just recently EasyFi was hacked. Don’t these exploits harm adoption?We should think about it as free markets. In free markets, eventually you have a way to create the alpha in the market that emerges out of it. You have these solutions like Compound, Aave and others that are extensively audited. They have not been hacked that much. Even in some larger protocols, like MakerDAO that have gotten hacked, it did not deplete it completely. It was a few million dollars, which is nothing compared to the size of the whole ecosystem. And then the community learns something, and that’s how it evolves. That’s the power of the network, of Ethereum.See also: Did Ethereum Learn Anything From the $55M DAO Attack?If you think there will be a future of programmable money, then that programmable money is going to be hacked. There is no way that it wouldn’t be. There were big hacks in Web 2.0, and there will be in Web 3.0 also. But that’s how the industry evolves. They are not bad things. I was looking at your calendar, and it looks like you have calls after this. Do you ever get to sleep?Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have one more call after this, then, after that, some internal calls. Generally, I end up doing 16-17 calls a day, so about 12 hours only on calls. Then I rest five-six hours and work to have things to discuss on those calls. My life is always spending. Personal life gets affected a lot. And this is not only for me. Everybody who is doing anything significant in crypto is going through the same situation. I think it’s the nature of the industry. The assets never sleep, there’s no holidays, no Christmas, no year-end holidays. People have said before there will be studies on mental health on the people in crypto. People in this industry are mentally... I myself have had medical issues. I have had to be on constant medication, but then I can’t take a break, so I have to keep going with medication. This is such a huge topic, and I think it’s only gotten worse during the pandemic. When you are building your own token startup, basically you are a public company, you have similar obligations as being a public company because everything is on view. Plus, you have to handle all of the pressure of being a startup. You have to build your product, find your customers and all that. The pressure is multifold. You are working in the finance industry and you are working in a startup – both are extremely excruciating things, but together in one job. It has been very taxing. On a personal level, professional level I feel like I have aged a lot. I’ll be 34 this July. Kids call me ‘uncle’ already. It seems like the Indian ecosystem is poised to explode, but it’s also being hampered by regulatory uncertainty. Could you give a little insight into the legal situation?The legal situation has been overly sensationalized by the media. And that was the object of the Indian government: to keep a shadow of uncertainty over crypto in India, so retail does not get into it. They also tried to bring a shadow ban via RBI, the Bank of India. But that was not a ban by law. And also, obviously, India is a leading country – not as strong as in the U.S. – in terms of material liberty. People challenged the ban in court, the court overturned it and all that. The moment that happened the whole industry exploded and India is back to being one of the top regions for crypto. What’s the appeal of working in crypto in India?Developers have really found a gold mine here. Elite developers are getting into it, because they get paid in dollars. If they take USD, their salaries go up relative to those getting paid in rupees. It’s very lucrative. It’s difficult to find comparative salaries here. The salaries will likely continue to rise over the next three to four years, approaching what you have in Silicon Valley. See also: How Normies Are Getting Crypto-Rich With DeFiI think the salaries for good developers across the world will start approaching some global standard. Right now, a $60,000 salary in India would get you a senior developer. In SF (San Francisco), that would get you a college student. So the scene is poised to explode. And that’s part of the reason the government is unlikely to ban it outright. It’s an important front for the country. They are definitely going to regulate it, though. ",2021-04-27
3757,"Bitcoin was up Tuesday despite lower-than-average spot volumes. Meanwhile, ether’s price hits record high and the cyrpto's dominance is back at February levels.The price of bitcoin climbed as high as $55,261 around 17:00 GMT (12 PM ET) before settling to $54,840 as of press time. It’s possible the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could be headed higher. “A test of the $56,000 mark will soon follow, then will most likely roll back,” said Constantine Kogan, a partner at investment firm Wave Financial. According to CoinDesk 20 data, bitcoin was last at $56,000 on April 20, when it declined from the all-time high price of $64,829 reached April 14.The rise this week comes after bitcoin's price went as low as $47,272 on Sunday. Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer for investment firm Ether Capital, says dumps and recoveries are just part of the crypto market. “I think the weekend sell-off was overdone, personally, so a bounce back makes sense,” Coolican said. Spot bitcoin exchange volumes for Tuesday were around $2.6 billion as of press time, compared with the past three months’ average of $5.1 billion of BTC changing hands daily. It’s possible larger players are the ones in the market this week, with retail and new investors remaining cautious because of crypto’s notorious gyration. This caused lower volumes Tuesday. “Bitcoin is an information-asymmetry environment,” Wave’s Kogan said. “A small number in the community are aware of impending price changes, and only a small number of global venues are able to manage these large trades.”Despite the volume doldrums, a positive news cycle is affecting bitcoin’s price, Kogan said. “JPMorgan is preparing to launch an actively managed bitcoin fund for high-net-worth clients,” Kogan said. “Tesla announced the sale of part of [its] bitcoins and profit taking, which is also positive. This helps the bullish trend. ”Read More: Bitcoin Options Market Eyes $4.2B in Expiries on FridayThe second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Tuesday, trading around $2,631 and climbing 5.2% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). Ether rose Tuesday to a record high price near $2,700 after a powerful three-day rally.The price of ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, climbed as high as $2,683.30 around 16:00 UTC (12 p.m. ET), based on CoinDesk data. The new high came after three straight daily gains totaling 19%. The move extended the cryptocurrency’s stunning rally this year. Ether's price has tripled thus far in 2021, in part thanks to trader enthusiasm over growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens, both of which use the Ethereum blockchain. Bitcoin (BTC), by comparison, is up 89% this year.“Ether has picked up its head and looks poised for a few more days of outperformance,” said Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for the consulting firm Fairlead Strategies.Technical progress on Ethereum may be enticing investors to buy, said Ether Capital’s Coolican. “It’s just more people understanding the value [proposition] of Ethereum and the token accrual model with proof-of-stake and EIP 1559,” Coolican told CoinDesk. Proof-of-stake is the more efficient form of consensus for cryptocurrency networks to which Ethereum is upgrading, and EIP 1559 is a development proposal expected to reduce fees on the network. Read More: Bitmain to Release Antminer E9 ASIC for Ethereum MiningOn a day when all major assets on the CoinDesk 20 were up, the meme-centric cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) was struggling to stay in the green. Wave Financial’s Kogan says interest in DOGE waxes and wanes at its own rhythm. “They are good in memes creation, I give them that. But I'm very skeptical about this Doge mania,” he told CoinDesk. “It may end up badly, with retail investors losing a lot of money.

3760,"Billionaire investor, “Shark Tank” personality and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban explained the dogecoin phenomenon to millions of viewers of Ellen DeGeneres’ daytime talk show on Tuesday, describing the much-hyped cryptocurrency as “a whole lot better” of an investment “than a lottery ticket.”Besides ""doja-coin,"" Cuban and DeGeneres discussed non-fungible tokens on the episode, which Cuban described as “just a digital collectible that you can buy, hold, sell like any other collectible.” DeGeneres tweeted Monday that she is auctioning an NFT to benefit World Central Kitchen. That Cuban was discussing dogecoin on ""Ellen,"" a daily talk show with an average of 1.5 million viewers, many of whom are women below the age of 54, could bring the Shiba Inu-themed crypto into the mainstream. “Cryptocurrency is just an asset to invest in. Bitcoin is kind of like a digital version of gold. Ethereum is a digital version of a currency,” Cuban told DeGeneres. “And then you got dogecoin, which is just fun. But the weird part about it [is] it went from being a cryptocurrency joke to now becoming something that’s becoming a digital currency.”Cuban explained that his 11-year-old son, Jake, is involved in dogecoin, with the two Cubans buying “$30 worth.”“So the question everyone wants to know, is dogecoin a good investment? And here’s the reason I got Jake into it. It’s not necessarily the best investment you can make, but you can buy it on Robinhood, and signing up and trading on Robinhood is free. So that’s one thing,” Cuban said.“The second thing is it’s about 26 cents per dogecoin. So if you go and spend five, 10, 15 dollars, that’s a better investment than buying a lottery ticket. And you know what? It could go up,” he continued. “It’s also becoming a digital currency, which is crazy if you think back to its origins.” Cuban noted his Mavericks basketball team's store accepts dogecoin for merchandise, and suggested DeGeneres do the same for her Ellen Shop. (He did not mention that spending even trivial amounts of crypto on goods and services can incur a tax liability in the U.S.)“But, overall, when someone brings up dogecoin to you and asks you if it’s a good investment, I wouldn’t say it’s the world’s best investment, but it’s a whole lot better than a lottery ticket and it’s a great way to learn and start understanding cryptocurrencies,” Cuban said. “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” had an average of 1.5 million viewers over the past six months, down from 2.6 million viewers for the same period in 2020, according to a recent report in the New York Times quoting data from research firm Nielsen. The core audience for “Ellen” is adult women below the age of 54, according to Nielsen. In September, DeGeneres publicly apologized on the show for allegations of workplace misconduct. Cuban did not mention risk factors such as dogecoin's unlimited supply and sparse technical development.He did, however, explain one of the realities of trading crypto on regulated platforms: they collect sensitive personal information from users.After DeGeneres said she felt uncomfortable because Robinhood asks for a Social Security number, Cuban gave the audience a primer in anti-money-laundering requirements.""There's something called know-your-customer,"" he said. ""They have to make sure you're not a money launderer or a fraudster, and so they have to confirm your identity.""As if to reassure viewers, he said Robinhood is ""pretty good at keeping [data] secure. ...

3761,"What is enterprise DeFi? It depends on who you ask. If you ask Paul Brody, at EY, it’s about enterprises using  DeFi (decentralized finance). If you ask Cordite’s Richard Crook, it’s about corporations operating a slightly less centralized network using “DLT” (distributed ledger technology) in a consortium environment.If you ask me, it’s about creating new, decentralized web-scale enterprise structures and effective internet-based coordination mechanisms among known or unknown legal and natural persons. In other words, governance is everything.Paul's and Richard’s perspectives are entirely valid and certainly part of the picture. From my perspective, enterprise DeFi must decentralize the enterprise, not centralize DeFi software in the hands of legacy corporate structures. Thanks to the army of mathematics and physics PhDs whom Wall Street hired between 1970 to 2008, it is incredibly difficult to invent new finance. With the rare exception of, say, flash loans, any competent quant can map financial innovations in DeFi 1:1 to a previous financial innovation on Wall Street.That means the real innovation in DeFi is decentralization, and even that has roots and parallels in the history of money and commerce. Decision-making by token-holder voting is not entirely different from proxy voting, and traders guilds in ancient India and medieval Italy ran mutualized lending, trading, insurance, money and asset management services using similar decision-making systems.Public blockchain technology enables decentralization to work at internet-scale among pseudonymous participants who don’t need to trust or even know each other, and that’s a pretty big deal. Ergo, if becoming enterprise means losing this core aspect of decentralization at web-scale, then it’s just CeFi (centralized finance) or legacy-Fi on the blockchain, not DeFi.So what exactly is decentralization? I have written about the topic over the years. The key question to ask in assessing if something is decentralized is the governance question, i.e. who has control over decision-making and to what extent? That has two dimensions – technical decentralization and economic decentralization.Technical decentralization means that anyone can use or contribute to the software or technical infrastructure created for the decentralized product or service. In DeFi, the deployment, enhancement and operation of the software is not controlled by any one legal or natural person. The open-source nature and public blockchain deployment of DeFi is therefore non-negotiable.  Using a public permissionless blockchain helps because it exposes the functionality to everyone who cares to examine or reuse it, but it’s not sufficient. If a crypto exchange builds and runs smart contract-based applications on a public permissionless blockchain, but 95% of the commits to the blockchain come from employees or contractors of the exchange, the blockchain is not very decentralized. Also, if the exchange can reorganize the blockchain at will, then such DeFi applications are certainly not decentralized. In fact, Linux and MySQL are more decentralized than such dapps. Similarly, if the founding team of a DeFi protocol controls the admin key that can be used to make arbitrary code changes, then such a protocol is not very decentralized. As it turns out, not all open-source software is the same, and some open-source software ships with licensing that gives special rights or even control to the creators of the software. The fewer such rights and restrictions embedded in DeFi software, the more decentralized such software is. In essence, I believe no license is more decentralized than GNU licensing, which in turn is more decentralized than MIT licensing, which again is more decentralized than Apache licensing. The legal rights and restrictions embedded in the software licensing are much more important.Taking technical decentralization to enterprise requires some compromise because enterprise needs to be commercially incentivized to use the software and because enterprise entities often assume liability for non-performance of the software or the service. That is why Geth (which allows anyone to run an Ethereum node) ships under GNU licensing and Hyperledger Besu ships under Apache 2.0 licensing. Economic decentralization has two core aspects: control and liability. The less concentrated each of these is, the more decentralized the protocol. Enterprise structures, whether sole trader businesses, partnerships or corporations, are defined by who makes the decisions that govern the operation of the service offered and who has the liability for nonperformance. A limited liability corporation, which is the most popular enterprise structure, assigns limited liabilities to principals, i.e. owners/shareholders. The liabilities for nonperformance often sit with agents, i.e. managers whom shareholders hire to make decisions on their behalf. When the agents’ incentives are not aligned with the principals', it leads to principal-agent conflict. A classic example: When Wall Street execs make decisions to maximize their bonuses, rather than long-term shareholder value. Indeed, there are even aspects of decentralization within centralized corporations. The level of economic decentralization depends on the level of concentration in stakeholder voting. Before the existence of blockchain technology, internet-scale coordination of stakeholder votes was practically nonviable. Shareholders had to elect a board of directors to represent them. In such a structure, if the CEO of a corporation can push any decision through on a whim without any pushback from a board looking out for long-term value, such a corporation is more centralized. Similarly, there are elements of centralization even within DeFi protocols, and as Securities and Exchange Commission commissioner Hester Peirce’s safe harbor proposal recognizes, nearly everything starts centralized. Bitcoin, the first ever DeFi protocol, started with one guy writing a white paper on an obscure internet channel and then a few developers, like Gavin Andresen, writing the bulk of the code.  Over the next few years, bitcoin (BTC) became widely distributed, and the number of contributors to bitcoin core grew from three people to a few hundred people. The fact that bitcoin was practically worthless but practically brilliant in the early days meant people weren’t hoarding as many bitcoins as they could or running giant mining pools next to hydropower dams. In fact, one could even argue that after the initial years of rapid decentralization, bitcoin has become more economically and technically centralized as its value has gone up hundreds of times. In the case of a DeFi protocol, the exam question is how much more decentralized it is than when it started and what’s the rate of increase in decentralization? Are tokens becoming less concentrated in the hands of whales? Is the team using treasury to force decisions? Is the team controlling an admin key to force decisions through? Are a few large whales making decisions? Does a participant need to buy tokens on an exchange before they can vote, or if they have a good idea that benefits the community, can they just ask the community to delegate votes to them? DeFi and enterprise have a lot to learn from each other. The most important thing enterprises can learn from DeFi is how to use public permissionless blockchain technology to become more technically and economically decentralized to enable much greater fairness and inclusion in economic activity. For example, corporations can employ public blockchain technology for shareholder voting and limit the role of the board of directors to guardians rather than often conflicted intermediaries. Corporations can further enable shareholders to delegate votes to other stakeholders in the society and thus alleviate the externalities and ill effects of shareholder capitalism.Then there is a lot of technical innovation and practices to be shared. Specifically in enterprise blockchain, a lot of work has been done on security, data privacy and software engineering practices. In DeFi, there’s an infinite library of robust, battle-tested smart contracts built by highly motivated and talented engineers that enterprises can simply adapt or use. DeFi protocols can also benefit from robust software development, testing and deployment practices established in enterprise software. And yes, of course, enterprises can simply plug into DeFi and benefit from the growing asset liquidity, the return generation opportunities and the entire category of peer-to-peer and peer-to-protocol web 3 commerce that is coming online with non-fungible tokens.  Most of all, forward-thinking enterprises can facilitate the legal innovation that’s required to provide a firm legal foundation for decentralized protocols. A recent and extremely pertinent example is the Wyoming DAO (decentralized autonomous organizations) Law. As DeFi goes to enterprise, we will use more of such legal innovation to decentralize the enterprise rather than building centralized, hierarchical, rent-seeking entities on decentralized technology.",2021-04-27
3762,"These days it’s become common for people to ask, what is money? It’s a fair question. There’ve been more than a few events this past year that have complicated, if not outright challenged, the usual, everyday, whip-out-your-credit-card-and-pay mentality when it comes to spending. The U.S. monetary supply has expanded by 30%, for instance. Can money just expand like that? Then there are all these acronyms for new financial tools: NFTs, SPACs, DOGE. At the very least, these things cost a lot of money.The usual line economists take is that money serves three functions in an economy. It’s a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. It’s a simple checklist to determine if some asset has the right attributes and can rightfully be called money. In 2014, NYU professor David Yermack called bitcoin a “marginally useful,” money-like commodity popular among hackers and “opponents of the banking system.” Just yesterday, a fifth National Football League star announced he’d take at least a portion of his compensation in BTC.Bitcoin has escaped from its nerdy, anarcho-capitalist roots and entered the financial mainstream. It’s accepted as payment at Tesla and WeWork. Institutional giants are buying and holding bitcoins. At least some things – usually other cryptos – are natively priced in bitcoin. So is bitcoin money? Here are three views:Money is and has always been, as CoinDesk Chief Content Office Michael Casey says, a collective imagination. There’s no intrinsic aspect that makes money, money. Instead, it is whatever object on which we can all agree has steady, transactional value. Yap stones, gold and fiat. Bitcoin is the latest chapter in this shared imagining, a new, digital good that bypasses the sovereign issuer and presents the world with a freely accessible standard.Bitcoin, under this framework, is money when it crosses some undefined, ineffable standard of adoption, such as when there are finally enough people that say, “sure, pay me in bitcoin.” No one knows where the line is, but this weekend’s New York Times ran a story with the headline, “We’re All Crypto People Now.” So it’s possible we’ve crossed it.In 2018, at the tail end of that year’s supercycle, the St. Louis Federal Reserve raised the question, is bitcoin money or a financial instrument? “The line between money and financial asset [sic] is not clear,” the economists wrote. “People's actions often reveal the role the asset is playing in the economy.”Although introduced to the world as digital, peer-to-peer cash, bitcoin had not yet taken up that role, the Fed economists said. Instead, it was a “highly speculative asset.” A potential bubble. An inadequate currency due to its price fluctuation and limited liquidity, that few were actually using “to buy goods and services.”Three years on, there are still more than a few people who take this view. The journalist Brett Scott argued that bitcoin has been successfully branded as a deflationary good by financially conservative fearmongers. Although bitcoin may be used to purchase goods, that wouldn’t be proof a cash-equivalent transaction had taken place. Instead, it would be a countertrade between two assets. Just think about where you’re likely to come into possession of BTC: by buying from a crypto exchange.That said, bitcoin is different from other commodities. It was designed to be fungible, to be broken down into small units of account and to be easily transferable and stored. Perhaps that’s what Scott means by “ornate digital collectible.” But few other digital goods have all those cash-like qualities.The Federal Reserve hasn’t released an accounting of the current crypto supercycle, yet, so it’s difficult to say whether the central bank's thinking on bitcoin has changed. But it has published a DeFi explainer.It’s possible bitcoin is all of these things and more. It functions like cash. It also functions like a speculative asset. People are buying it as an inflation hedge as well as for its volatility. It’s a burgeoning global reserve currency and a distributed ledger on which to run decentralized applications.The question whether bitcoin is real money is reductive. This is especially the case when you consider its metaphysical properties. Bitcoins don’t exist in the world, but to what extent do they exist at all?Northern Illinois University assistant professor Craig Warmke pushes back against the idea that bitcoin exists as a chunk of code. It isn't real. Instead, he argues, Bitcoin is “a fictional substance in a massively coauthored story on a network.”In other words: “Bitcoin just is.”UPDATE: 4/28 (16:18 UTC): Corrects Craig Warmke's title, he is an assistant professor not an associate professor.

3764,"Bitcoin miners in southern China are back online after a series of coal mining accidents led to outages last week, cascading Bitcoin’s hashrate at same time as bitcoin’s (BTC) price.Bitcoin’s hashrate – an estimate of how much computational power miners produce at a given time – has recovered from roughly 125 exahashes per second following the outages to nearly 160 exahashes per second, according to mining pool API data.Miners in the coal-abundant Xinjiang province began bringing their machines online at the end of last week, while more came online over the weekend though at a slower rate than expected, F2Pool Director of Global Finance and Business Development Liang Da told CoinDesk.""The total hashrate is around 150 exahashes a second right now. The recovery is slower than expected,"" he said,  adding that the network needs another 20 exahashes or so to come online before it is at pre-outage levels.Compass Mining CEO Thomas Heller told CoinDesk the network's current hashrate could be higher than the nearly 160 exahashes reported by mining pool APIs when factoring in miners who keep their data private like Foundry. The affected miners rely on cheap coal during China’s dry season to power their machines. Once the rains pick up at the end of May, most will migrate to Northern China to make use of this region’s cheap hydroelectric power.Igor Runets, the CEO of bitcoin mining colocation firm BitRiver, told CoinDesk that the outages, though temporary, underscore Chinese mining centralization as well as the need to move toward renewables.“Although the drop in hashrate was temporary, it was yet another sign of both the unreliability of non-renewable sources of energy for bitcoin mining and the centralization of mining in China. I believe that bitcoin mining’s future is green, and places with surplus renewable energy have the most potential for it,” he said.In light of the current bull market, bitcoin’s energy footprint has yet again come under scrutiny, with some newcomers intent on buying “clean” bitcoin that only comes from renewables mining. North American ventures like Blockcap and Gryphon focus on renewables-only mining, while others use a mix of renewables and natural gas.As these North American companies scale, using renewables or not, more hashrate is coming to North America, but the region still has a long way to go before it matches China’s majority share of the world’s hashrate.",2021-04-27
3765,"The inflation scare looks to be spreading to stock markets from the bond and bitcoin markets. Suddenly, it’s a top-of-the-mind concern for Wall Street analysts peppering CEOs with questions during quarterly earnings conference calls. According to a new report from Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. bank, the number of mentions of ""inflation"" in earnings calls of Standard & Poor’s 500 companies has more than tripled year on year, the most significant jump in 17 years. The bank published the note Monday, according to MarketWatch. Strategists cited raw materials, transportation and labor as major potential drivers of inflation, adding that the number of mentions of inflation has historically led the consumer price index (CPI) by a quarter, with a 52% correlation. As per Bloomberg, several companies have begun passing on higher costs to consumers. Bond markets have been predicting a pickup in inflation for at least a year. Inflation expectations for the second half of the coming decade have more than doubled since the March 2020 crash to a 30-month high of 2.25%, per data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Bitcoin has risen roughly in tandem with inflation expectations over the past 13 months – since just after the March crash – and recently hit record highs above $64,000. Though the price has since settled back to about  $55,200, the cryptocurrency is still up about 90% this year alone. Several publicly listed companies such as Tesla and MicroStrategy have already adopted bitcoin as an asset within their corporate treasuries, casting the cryptocurrency as a store of value, like a digital version of gold. ""What we’re trying to do is preserve our treasury; the purchasing power of the cash is debasing rapidly,"" MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor told CoinDesk in November. ""Bitcoin is a million times better than antiquated gold."" MicroStrategy has announced purchases of 91,326 BTC worth $5.02 billion. The U.S. electric car maker Tesla sold 10% of its bitcoin holdings in the first quarter for $272 million in proceeds, having snapped up coins worth $1.5 billion in January. “We’ve been quite pleased with how much liquidity there is in the bitcoin market,” Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn told analysts Monday on a conference call, according to a transcript. “Our ability to build our first position happened very quickly. When we did the sale later in March, we also were able to execute on that very quickly.”There’s ample speculation whether other corporations might follow suit, with inflation expectations rising on Main Street and bitcoin outshining traditional assets over the past 13 months.The yellow metal, a traditional inflation hedge, has risen by a paltry 22% in the past 13 months, and Bloomberg's commodity index has jumped by 50%.Also read: Bitcoin Options Market Eyes $4.2B Expiry on Friday ",2021-04-27
3766,"Bitcoin and crypto-mining monolith Bitmain is releasing an application specific circuit (ASIC) miner for Ethereum, another indicator the Ethereum mining industry is doubling down on proof-of-work, even as its developers gear up for the blockchain’s shift to proof-of-stake.Bitmain released a video for the new Antminer E9, which it claims will do the work of 32 graphics cards (GPUs), the expensive processors typically coveted by PC gamers that are also used by miners to mine for ether and other coins. The advertisement says the machines can produce up to 3 gigahashes per second (the best GPUs produce roughly 100 megahashes per second).Ethereum, like other so-called ASIC-resistant blockchains that use a different hashing algorithm than Bitcoin’s SHA-256, are supposed to reject hashes from ASICs, which are designed to produce hashes for mining purposes only, and serve no other computing function (like graphics for gaming. for example). Still, as evidenced by the E9 and other crypto ASICs, manufacturers have found ways around these limitations.Bitmain’s product release follows GPU maker Nvidia’s rollout of mining-specific graphics cards, a response to card shortages as the crypto market’s mining boom has squeezed supply chains and driven up costs for gamers. As miners purchase these products, it underscores a tension between an Ethereum mining industry that is heavily invested in proof-of-work while its community and developers make moves toward a new network in Ethereum 2.0 and proof-of-stake.Even as changes are made to Ethereum’s design to mitigate high transaction fees (such as the recent miner-opposed EIP 1559 rule that burns a percentage of transaction fees), miners are showing no indication that they will leave this Ethereum chain for the new proof-of-stake Ethereum 2.0 when the time comes.

As new protocols mature, the team has innovated with products that enhance the user experience.”Multi-party computation (MPC) breaks up long cryptographic keys. According to ZenGo, that saves customers from having to write down private keys or remember passwords, and protects them even if their phone is lost or stolen, according to the company. Instead, the wallet relies on facial biometrics to allow user access.More generally, it allows for large pools of data to stay encrypted while permitting information to be extracted from those data pools using encrypted computations.“We believe that a true crypto-based future will require solutions that are radically simple, mobile-first, and built on-chain”, said Ohayon in a statement. “Our approach to security, based on MPC, eliminates traditional single points of failure, and has helped us build an innovative consumer-grade wallet that makes crypto simpler, and also an order of magnitude safer.”The company pitches itself as a ""third generation"" keyless wallet built on MPC, thereby removing private keys and single secrets out of the security equation.",2021-04-27
3768,"“It’s a really tricky needle to thread.” That’s how former Federal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm describes the task at hand for Chair Jerome Powell at the Fed meeting this week. Bitcoin (BTC) traders aren't sure he can pull it off.  Considering the massive economic dislocation over the past year from the coronavirus, the current level of interest rates and monetary stimulus appears to be just right, and data on everything from inflation to employment is about as good as one might hope. Powell’s challenge will be to convince investors the Fed can maintain the pristine conditions even as the economy reactivates, potentially sparking a surge in consumer demand that could lead to faster inflation. Investors will be watching for any advance indications as to how quickly output would have to ramp up before the Fed moves to taper its $120 billion-a-month of bond purchases – an extreme form of loose monetary policy – and eventually raises interest rates, currently set at near 0%. It’s a key question for traders in the market for bitcoin, seen by many big institutional investors as a hedge against the runaway inflation that might transpire if the Fed were to lose control. At issue is the credibility and resolve of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, which is the panel at the U.S. central bank that sets monetary policy. “The Fed is going to have to work really hard to convince people that they’re honest,” says Sahm, now a senior fellow at the Jain Family Institute. “Like if things get out of hand, they will adjust, they will raise rates, but they don't want them to think they're going to raise rates.”According to economists at Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. bank, investors in traditional markets will be focused on whether Powell shifts his language around when “substantial further progress” will have been made in the economy. Economists at Bank of the West, a unit of the giant French bank BNP Paribas, project that Fed officials will start talking about tapering their bond purchases later this year, with the actual tapering to begin in early 2022. Under their scenario, the first interest-rate hike would happen in the third quarter of 2023.The two-day, closed-door meeting starts Tuesday and culminates Wednesday with the FOMC decision at 2 p.m. ET. The FOMC press conference with Powell is right afterward at 2:30 p.m. The FOMC decision will be closely scrutinized by traders in the bitcoin market, especially because this year's 90% price rally, fueled by speculation that faster inflation might be on the way, has stalled out in recent weeks. As of early Tuesday, bitcoin was changing hands around $55,000. It's bitcoin, of course, where price volatility is the norm, so anything can happen, but the largest cryptocurrency is well off its all-time high price reached earlier this month around $65,000.    The Fed meeting follows a string of several weeks of positive economic data. The U.S. added 916,000 jobs in March, far above the expected 675,000, with pandemic-wrecked portions of the economy like leisure and hospitality leading the way. U.S. headline inflation in March came in at 2.6% over the prior 12 months, slightly faster than the expected 2.5%, based on the Labor Department’s consumer price index (CPI). Even that result might not be anathema to the Fed, since Powell has explicitly expressed his wish for inflation to average over 2%, at least for a while.Gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest gauge of economic activity, appears to be on a path toward robust growth. Oxford Economics has revised up its estimate for U.S. GDP this year to 8% from 7.2%, said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist for the forecasting firm.Such momentum means that markets may see a more relaxed and confident Powell on Wednesday, said Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, an initiative focused on understanding financial crises.“If you would have offered everyone on the FOMC the last six weeks of data, they would have accepted the deal,” Kelly said. “If we were in 2019 and CPI was bumping up a little higher in a way that hadn’t been communicated, there would be volatility in the bond market. But they’ve been very clear that inflation will bump above 2%.”With the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes around 1.55%, down from as high as 1.7% in March, there’s little pressure on the Fed to consider experimental monetary policies like “Operation Twist” and “yield curve control” that might loosen financial conditions further. Inflation-adjusted yields on 10-year Treasurys – the nominal yield, minus the inflation rate – are at negative levels, said Bostjancic. They’re currently around -0.77%, down from 0.15% before the pandemic. On that basis, the 10-year yield could climb roughly 0.9 percentage point before conditions returned to pre-pandemic levels. In other words Powell’s got plenty of headroom on that front.   Even though Oxford projects 1.9% for the nominal 10-year Treasury yield by the end of the year, the numbers add up to “near the easiest financial conditions we’ve ever had,” Bostjancic added. The FOMC will likely stay the course on keeping the target rate for federal funds in a range of 0% to 0.25%, while maintaining the monthly asset purchases at $80 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds and $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities. It might be a sign the Fed sees no urgency in beginning to normalize conditions, a step taken recently by the Bank of Canada.With 8.5 million Americans unemployed, there’s a long way before full employment is reached. Powell has talked about this, and it's likely to be on the agenda again at this week's FOMC meeting.  Lower unemployment could force businesses to compete for the shrinking pool of available labor, leading to higher wages. But higher inflation could also increase the cost of living, hurting the lowest income earners in society. One trade-off is that inflation makes it easier for borrowers to repay debt, Sahm said. “It helps borrowers on the reverse side,” Sahm said. “If there's higher inflation and wages tend to grow faster than prices, that means it takes less of your money down the road to pay back the bank. ... Most economists, who are rich people, do not talk about the distributional effects of inflation.” What makes bitcoin traders skeptical is the so-called Goldilocks scenario: that everything stays exactly as it is for the Fed meeting this week, rising gradually and in sync. Corporations see increased profits as consumer demand rises, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus from the U.S. government. Investors benefit from an uplift of asset prices. Inflation ticks up a bit, but not too much. Eventually the Fed has enough legroom to remove the monetary stimulus. “The Fed will eventually slow down the asset purchases and probably end the asset purchases,” Sahm said. “The whole point of this is to get the U.S. economy to a better place. If the economy is in a better place, we’re in a good place to invest and asset prices go up.”Even after this week's Fed meeting has passed, getting there will be the tricky part.  ",2021-04-27
3769,"Bitcoin (BTC) is roughly 16% higher off the $47,000 weekend low as buyers responded to oversold conditions. The cryptocurrency was trading around $54,700 at the time of writing. The next level of resistance is around $56,000.",2021-04-27
3770,"Bitcoin (BTC) has begun the monthly options expiry week on a positive note, rising from $48,000 to over $54,000.Further gains may remain elusive for a while or unfold at a slower pace, as the max pain point for Friday's $4.2 billion options expiry is $54,000.As discussed last month, call and put sellers, typically institutions with ample capital supply, often manipulate and pin the price of the underlying toward the max pain point while heading into the expiry.Doing so ensures that maximum options expire worthlessly – buyers lose maximum money, that is, the premium paid while purchasing options, while sellers or recipients of premium make the most.In other words, buyers of call and put options expiring on April 30 will suffer maximum loss if bitcoin settles at $54,000 on Friday. Meanwhile, sellers would make the highest profit. Therefore, option writers may try and keep prices around $54,000.Almost all the options contracts expiring will do so at 8:00 coordinated universal time – the designated moment for monthly contracts traded on Deribit, which is the dominant exchange for cryptocurrency options.It is difficult to prove whether max pain pinning is real or coincidental because bitcoin's options market is still relatively small for the expiry to have a sizable impact on the spot price.At press time, the total number of outstanding bitcoin options contracts – or open interest – is around $13 billion or 1.3% of bitcoin's total market capitalization of $1.03 trillion, according to data source Skew. Further, only 77,000 contracts worth $4.2 billion are set to expire this Friday. That's 0.3% of bitcoin's market capitalization.Nevertheless, traders can benefit from keeping an eye on the max pain, especially as expiry nears.""Options and futures are new critical datapoints for traders. While bitcoin was up +103% in the first quarter, we saw huge pullbacks end of each month,"" Messari researcher Mira Christanto recently noted in a tweet thread detailing the effect of max pain on bitcoin's price. The month-end pullbacks happened as back then the max pain point was well below the spot price. For instance, the cryptocurrency fell from nearly $60,000 to $50,000 in the six days leading up to the March 26 expiry but did not go all the way down to the then max pain point of $44,000.Also read: Bitcoin Price Jumps 9%, Most Since Early MarchThe max pain turned out to be a temporary bearish hangover because the cryptocurrency reversed course after the expiry and clocked highs above $60,000 on April 2.This time, the cryptocurrency has bounced to the max pain point ahead of the expiry.

3772,"Think back to April 2020, when coronavirus-related lockdowns were hitting the global economy hard, and only the most sanguine optimists – and politicians – saw any likelihood of a rapid reopening and rebound. At that point, the risk of deflation loomed large in the minds of many investors because of the steep drop-off in consumer demand. Prices for bitcoin, (BTC), seen by some cryptocurrency traders as a potential hedge against inflation, stagnated below $10,000, even though central banks around the world were printing trillions of dollars of fresh money.  A year later, the mentality has changed radically: With vaccines rolling out and economists now projecting a buoyant recovery, four in five investors see inflation as far more likely than deflation, according to a new survey by German lender Deutsche Bank. It's the second month in a row investors have logged such an overwhelming position, and so the idea appears to be sticking. Perhaps not coincidentally, bitcoin prices are now over $50,000. “A vast majority (81%) agree that inflation is more likely after the pandemic while only 10% thought we would see deflation,” according to Deutsche Bank. The survey was conducted earlier this month and covered about 700 global investors.Some 43% of investors responded that higher-than-expected inflation and rising bond yields pose the biggest risks to market stability, according to Deutsche Bank.

3773,"The price of bitcoin headed towards bearish territory Sunday before bouncing. Ether’s average fees have dropped over the past seven days, creating a potential trading advantage for some.Bitcoin jumped Monday, reaching as high as $54,340. It was a powerful reversal after prices fell as low as $47,272 around 23:00 GMT (6 PM ET) Sunday. The largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $54,076 as of press time.  Bitcoin’s recovery may spark momentum, according to technical analyst Katie Stockton of the Fairlead Strategies consulting firm. “The bounce should persist this week,” Stockton wrote in her ""Cryptocurrency Compass"" report on Monday. “But the recent loss of intermediate-term momentum suggests bitcoin will meet resistance below $62,000."" Based on CoinDesk 20 data, bitcoin has only been able to close above $60,000 on seven days in the entirety of its 12-year existence. All of those have occurred in the past three months.With the $60,000 price point being a level of “resistance” where some traders might start selling, Stockton sees $40,000 as the price level where investors will start scooping up what they perceive as cheap BTC. “Support is near $42,000 as a gauge of downside risk within the long-term uptrend,” Stockton noted. The news cycle is heavily dictating some of the price action in the crypto market, according to Michael Gord, chief executive officer of quantitative firm Global Digital Assets. “I think we are seeing more regulations around digital assets implemented globally,” Gord said. “This might cause investors to take a more conservative wait-and-see approach and perhaps exit some positions to hedge the risk.” There are a lot more eyeballs now on crypto. This may make some bitcoin traders more trigger-happy when it comes to the sell button.In the derivatives market, funding rates had turned negative, generally seen as sign that traders aren’t hungry for long leverage. They are still near zero, according to data aggregator Skew. Jason Lau, chief operating office of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin, sees a lasting market recovery and further upside.“With leverage and derivative activity still coming off all-time highs – bitcoin futures open interest has declined over 30% from the peaks – a spot-led recovery might be setting up bitcoin for another leg up,” Lau told CoinDesk. Read More: JPMorgan to Let Clients Invest in Bitcoin Fund for First TimeEther (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday, trading around $2,489 and climbing 9.7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). Over the past three months, the average fee paid on the Ethereum network to conduct transactions was approximately 0.0097 ETH. However, in the past week that average has dropped to 0.0079 ETH. It works out to an 18% reduction in the average cost of using the network, the primary ecosystem for decentralized finance (DeFi), consisting of programmable blockchain applications for trading, lending and derivatives.Many might welcome this news, as often Ethereum network fees have been so expensive that DeFi applications are unusable and more expensive than centralized or traditional financial platforms. However, Peter Chan, lead trader at quantitative firm OneBit Quant, says the fee improvement is a result of some traders building “bots,” or automatic systems, working directly with Ethereum miners. They have built a tool called MEV-geth that floods the network with transactions in the amount of 0 ETH in order to spot a preferential transaction sequence. The dynamic appears to be resulting in an advantage for the traders. “Basically, some of the bots decided to work with miners and there are immense amounts of zero-gas transactions mined,” Chan told CoinDesk. “The problem is that only whitelisted miners will be able to see these transactions, unlike where everyone can see in mempool.”The mempool is the list of network transactions waiting to be processed and confirmed by the Ethereum miners. “This black box creates asymmetric information tilted towards the miners,” Chan added. He suggested that people need to be cautious some more-advanced traders are getting information faster than others as a result of this cooperation with Ethereum miners. The bot uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism similar to the Bitcoin blockchain’s.The Ethereum 2.0 network upgrade on the horizon plans to switch from proof-of-work mining, which relies on solving cryptographic puzzles by computers to run, to proof-of-stake, which requires cryptocurrency balances to run. “The best way to deal with this is to set a tighter slippage to protect your trade, especially if you are trading a niche token,” Chan said. Read More: DeFi Reshapes the CoinDesk 20Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all in the green Monday.

3776,"Forgers in Russia sold more than $13 million worth of fake money in exchange for bitcoin, the national police said Monday.Russian police arrested several people in the city of Nizhny Novgorod on allegations of peddling fake bank notes over the infamous Hydra darknet marketplace, Russian newspaper Kommersant reported Monday. The alleged criminals managed to sell about one billion rubles (about US$13.3 million) in fake bank notes via online shops on Hydra, according to the outlet's unnamed sources. Chainalysis considers Hydra the single biggest darknet marketplace in the world. The four people facing charges in a district court – Sergey Arisov, Ivan Aferov, Andrey Skvortsov and Oleg Efimov – reportedly printed bank notes and sold them on Hydra for bitcoin. When a buyer sent a payment, a courier would deliver a package with fake bank notes to a certain location and hide it. Then a courier would share the location with the buyer. Often the package would be buried in a public park or a suburban forest in Russia, giving this delivery method a nickname translated as “hidden treasure” (“klad” in Russian). According to Kommersant, the police got to the ring organizers after catching several couriers. Police seized computers and other equipment from the ring's headquarters. The fake bank notes would normally cost 10%-15% of their nominal value for big batches and up to 30% for smaller batches up to 150,000 rubles ($2,000).This CoinDesk reporter was able to find at least eight shops currently selling fake bank notes on Hydra. They offer bank notes with a nominal value 2,000 or 5,000 rubles, with prices starting at 0.0002 BTC for a bank note. All the shops recommended buyers spray the bank notes with hairspray after purchase to get the “required texture and typical crunchiness."" Names of brands guaranteeing such results were helpfully provided. According to buyers’ reviews, they would often find the “treasures” easily, and use the fake money to pay for things. In some cases the packages appeared slightly damaged, “stolen by mice” or not found at the designated spot. In one case, the buyer complained some people beat him up and took away the package.

3778,"I have been writing about EOS, once a top-10 blockchain, now in the top 30, since before the network launched.By and large, EOS token holders have disliked my reporting. Every time I put out a new post it would get roundly critiqued as ""FUD"" and even occasionally attacked specifically by Block.One founder Brendan Blumer.What no one ever did, though, was show where any of my reporting was substantively wrong on the facts. In fact, on occasion members of the community would admit the facts had been correct even if they pointed to an uncomfortable truth.What did happen, though, was I would put out a report on some facet of EOS that would frustrate its proponents. I would ignore the blockchain for a while, usually until someone in the ecosystem would bring something to my attention. More often than not, I would hear voices that had once decried my past “FUD” now decrying EOS or its creators.And, in fact, a new proposal from Block.One seems to implicitly acknowledge a number of points made in my past reporting.The proposal for stake-based voting and rewards on EOS basically follows the model that blockchains like Cosmos and Cardano use and that Ethereum has been working to deploy: sharing block rewards directly with users who stake to support validators (like Bitcoin's miners) on the network.As of now, EOS holders can stake their EOS to vote for a slate of block producers (BPs, what EOS calls validators). They could vote for as few as one and as many as 30; all their tokens vote equally for all the block producers a voter supports.Further, voting is basically continuous.The top 21 block producer candidates automatically share a quarter of the annual inflation (i.e., new supply) of new EOS distributed with each block. Some of the rest went to other block producer candidates who contributed to the network in other ways.The original plan had also included some inflation for developing the network but it turned out no one really cared about that so it was all burned.So let's go through the proposal and point out how it squares with concerns raised in my prior reporting. Each of the bolded parts below are straight from the post linked above.So this is the key change: Everyone who stakes and votes gets rewarded for doing so.When EOS kicked off there was this high-minded idea the block producers who did the best work for the network (not just validating, but developing apps and tools) would get the votes to earn the most rewards.That's not what happened at all, though, and the hardest-working block producers started leaving the network in frustration.Instead, block producers started paying people for their votes, something Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin had predicted would happen on his blog.As early EOS supporters left and new ones came into this new regime, the viewpoint on this reality went from being a bit of an embarrassing truth to becoming something Block.One's described as aligning the validators with token holders.So instead of block producers offering stakers specific deals for backing them, under this new vision the network itself would pay wallets that participate in governance, if the proposal is adopted.Under the current system a quarter of inflation goes to the top 21 block producers automatically (the ones who have complete power over network consensus) and the rest gets distributed to pretty much everyone who has users voting for them, pro-rata. Most of that goes to the top 21, too.So EOS proposes stripping out that automatic carve-out and distributing it all pro rata, assuming the leading BPs will still get the most payout anyway.This, to me, reads as an acknowledgement that frequently the BPs doing the most work for the network weren't actually the ones in the top 21. The ones earning the most were the BPs backed by whales turning their large holdings into even more EOS.This was the real black mark of the prior system: Many of the BPs just weren't validating blocks. It's kind of crazy when you think about it, but the system aligned them so poorly with the network that blocks would get missed all the time. Check out the data on AlohaEOS' reliability tracker.One entrepreneur told us he had to completely revise his code strategy for an EOS-based app because he couldn't trust it to do what he needed from block to block.So under this new approach, the entire system would be punished if blocks are missed. The theory is it will give all voters an incentive to support BPs who won't miss blocks.Which seems ... obvious.This is only a proposal, of course, and Block.One doesn't directly have the power to impose it on EOS. However, if it does move through without much difficulty, there's a good chance the network will work much better.That could be good, but it will illuminate one more issue that has hung over the network from the start.Most crypto true believers have already thought 21 organizations was much too few for a truly decentralized blockchain. But the progress of this proposal could reveal that the number is smaller still: That really just one organization has the power in EOS, and that's Block.One itself.",2021-04-26

Rivals Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have already announced plans to offer bitcoin exposure to their wealthy clients. While the cryptocurrency is gaining ground for the first time in six days, the options market continues to show bias for short-term puts, or bearish bets, with the one-week ""put-call"" skew above zero. Put-call skews measure the cost of puts relative to that of calls, and they’re seen as a gauge of the market’s bias. However, the metric has come off sharply to 6% from highs above 20% seen last week, an indication of reduced bearishness. According to some analysts, it’s a sign the market has bottomed out.Market chatter shows some investors are skeptical about the sustainability of the price bounce, as the weekly chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, has crossed below zero, in a sign of a bearish shift in the market sentiment. Seven of the past ten bear crosses on the weekly MACD histogram led to deeper price declines. As such, the latest developments on the MACD are a cause for concern for the bulls.

3781,"During the past year and a half, Trevor Jones has shattered multiple crypto art records. He has topped the highest bids on non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, including SuperRare, Nifty Gateway and MakersPlace. In February, his Bitcoin Angel set a record for the “most expensive open-edition NFT artwork” when it raked in $3.2 million.Jones, 51, didn’t go to college until his thirties and worked three to four jobs after graduating to support his painting career. Today, he still leads a relatively quiet life with his wife outside Edinburgh, Scotland. To him, his journey in the NFT art world has been “a crazy success story.” “It started with being depressed at 30 and deciding to do an art degree,” he says, “to [becoming] an overnight sensation.” His rise is emblematic of the transformative effect the recent NFT boom has had on artists’ lives. Far from an abstract internet phenomenon, NFTs are responsible for some becoming millionaires – in the exclusive art world no less, where it’s not easy to get rich.Since his foray into “crypto art” in 2018 – when he used augmented reality to transform paintings at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery into crypto bigwigs – Jones has become one of the most important artists minting NFTs. Everybody in the sector knows his name. He’s collaborated with Pak, whose work recently sold for $16.8 million at Sotheby’s. And when Beeple, who famously auctioned an NFT at Christie’s for $69.3 million in March, first hit him up for advice on how to make drops on Nifty Gateway last summer, Jones was too busy to respond (they later discussed collaborating). His next collaboration is with the rapper and filmmaker Ice Cube. As the hype around NFTs has grown, Jones still stands out as a classically trained artist in a digital world. Though many of his works include tech components (like animation, AR and of course, NFTs), his primary medium remains oil on canvas. Meanwhile, he’s watched the crypto art world evolve in a very short period of time. In a way, it’s come to look like the traditional art world he came up in. See also: Whale Shark’s NFT Collectors Playbook“In the early days …there really were only a handful of [crypto] artists. We all spoke to each other daily and got excited about who's doing what,” he says. “In the last six or so months, it’s really blown up…It mirrors the art world in general, with money, egos, and personalities, and everybody wanting a piece of the pie.”Growing up in a “small logging community” in Western Canada, Jones always excelled in art class, but his dream was to become a rock star. When that went “horribly wrong,” he says, he started backpacking around the world, and found himself “at a crossroads” in his early thirties while living in Edinburgh.“It's all very cliché,” he says, speaking from an unadorned spot in his home over Zoom in April. “I decided that I needed to become an artist to save myself and find redemption.”Several years later, at 38, he graduated from Edinburgh University and Edinburgh College of Art. He immediately landed a director job at the nonprofit Art in Healthcare. It was a competitive position, says Margaret Hurcombe, who hired him in 2008, but Jones stood out for his “practical skill set” - he had business sense in addition to artistic talent. At the time, Jones also taught art classes and rented out spare rooms in his apartment to make ends meet while working toward solo exhibitions. See also: ‘I’m Obsessed’: Paris Hilton on NFTs, Empowering Female Creators and the Future of ArtHe learned quickly that solo shows alone wouldn’t pay the bills. With galleries’ 50% commissions, and artists paying for their overhead costs like framing, he was left with about £9,000 from a show that took a year to produce.“I started looking at this objectively and rationally,” Jones says. In his early forties, he needed to find a niche that would distinguish him from other artists. So he started looking to technology, first painting QR codes in 2012 and venturing into AR in 2013.At the 2013 Edinburgh Art Fair, its founder and contemporary art dealer Andy McDougall remembers Jones showing up with “traditional looking” paintings of landscapes and animals. “We were all a little perplexed by this sudden change in style,” McDougall says, until Jones brought out his iPad and scanned it across his paintings, which began to move, play music and offer information about its subjects. “He could bring the paintings to life,” McDougall says.His timing was fateful. Around 2017, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) prices had begun to rise dramatically. Jones got caught up in trading. “I found out I’m a bit of a gambler,” he says. His “investing” efforts didn’t end well.But they did introduce him to new subject matter – the crypto sector, which hadn’t yet been explored by traditional artists. He painted portraits of Vitalik Buterin and John McAfee (who re-tweeted his work), and created his stealth AR exhibit at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Again, Jones had gambled, by spending so much time on works in this uncharted territory. This time, the gamble paid off. More and more people began following Jones on Twitter, where he has no qualms about self-promotion, and interest in his work pervaded the crypto market. By 2019, he was painting portraits for this publication’s “Most Influential” series. “That kind of solidified my reputation in the space as the go-to traditional painter,” he says.Though NFTs had been around for some time, Jones didn’t learn about them until April 2019, when the CEO of digital art marketplace KnownOrigin, David Moore, approached him at CoinFest in Manchester. “He was telling me about NFTs,” Jones says, “and I could not get my head around it at all.”A couple months later, Jones started seeing artists selling their work on KnownOrigin. “I thought, okay, I can’t ignore this anymore,” he says. So he messaged his friend Alotta Money, a French artist who had been selling his NFTs for hundreds of dollars.“All the NFT world wanted Trevor to get in,” says Alotta Money. “He asked me if I could help him.” Inspired by Picasso’s Girl with Mandolin (1910), their collaboration EthGirl features an animated girl in the shape of the Ethereum symbol, which separates to reveal Picasso’s pixelated eye. It broke SuperRare’s sale record when it sold for 72.1 ETH in December 2019. Jones’s description of the piece on SuperRare reads, “Watch this space. This is just the beginning.” He was right.The following year saw the launch of NFT art marketplaces like Nifty Gateway, which expanded the audience for NFTs by letting buyers pay with fiat. Jones sold his Picasso’s Bull there in July for $55,555, again breaking a platform record. Then 2021 ushered in multi-million NFT auctions by both Christie’s and Sotheby’s. Azealia Banks sold an NFT of her audio sex tape for $17,240, Grimes made an NFT artwork that sold for $5.8 million, and the “Leave Britney Alone” video creator, Chris Crocker, sold an NFT of that video for more than $44,000.See also: Noelle Acheson – What NFT ‘Markets for Emotion’ Say About Tech Business ModelsMany who got into NFTs since last summer “reference Picasso’s Bull NFT as the one that got them into the space,” says Jones. By the end of 2020, Jones had gone on to release his second collaboration with Alotta Money, which sold for about $140,000. His collaboration with Pak went for $1.4 million (Jones still doesn’t know Pak’s identity). To collectors, Jones’s work is worth holding onto. Colborn Bell, an NFT collector who owns Jones’ Putin portrait and Cubist Satoshi, says he wouldn’t sell a Jones – unless “some Russian oligarch showed up and was like, I need this Trevor Jones President Putin piece…and offered me an absurd amount of money.”With his background in the legacy art world, Jones could see the NFT market blowing up before it happened. “I knew there was going to be a Beeple who would come in and completely open things up,” he says. “I just didn’t know it was going to happen so quickly.”The acceleration of the market, Jones says, is both “good and bad.” There’s more money and attention available for emerging artists, who can make more from their work because NFT platforms take smaller cuts than traditional galleries and offer royalties for re-sales. But it also makes it harder for those emerging or lesser-known artists to get seen. Jones likes to help artists entering the market. As Aisha Arif, community manager at MakersPlace, a marketplace for digital art, puts it, “Trevor [is a] role model… On Twitter, he is constantly…offering valuable insights to help artists.”But these days, he gets flooded with messages. He can’t keep up with the inquiries, and plans to hire an assistant soon.The success, say friends and colleagues, hasn’t changed Jones – he has remained humble, gracious and a good friend. If anything, it’s made him more guarded. The negativity that can permeate the crypto sector reaches sensitive artists, and there were times in the past year when Jones has been tempted to “completely step away,” he says. Instead, he focuses on his work.After all, aspects of blockchain technology excite him from an artistic perspective, and will “completely shift the way art is consumed,” he says – like the Metaverse, where artists can show their NFT work in virtual worlds.See also: Brady Dale – NFTs Aren’t Art? OK, BoomerIn spite of his major success in the past year, Jones’s sudden wealth remains “a number on a screen” (well, several numbers—he holds bitcoin, ether and fiat). He still shops at the cheapest grocery store and doesn’t own a car, but he and his wife are looking at moving to southern Germany next year. He loves Edinburgh, but says that “the weather sucks.” In Germany, he will probably buy a Tesla.In the meantime, he’s using artificial intelligence in a hush-hush project and starting research for his latest collaboration – with Ice Cube. “It’s going to be a very powerful work with a strong message and not a 'celebrity cash-grab,’” Jones says. And he doesn’t think the NFT market is a bubble. Rather, it’s a fertile ground for the “future of ecommerce and art.”“When it comes down to money and art, there will always be one conclusion,” he says. “Is the money driving the space, or is art driving the space? And we'll see. We'll see what happens.”UPDATE (April 26, 15:20 UTC): Jones' Bitcoin Angel is a solo work, not a collaboration with Jose Delbo. ",2021-04-26
3782,"MATIC, the native token of Polygon Network, was gaining the most in a broad-based rally in cryptocurrencies on Monday, as investors look to layer 2 scaling solutions amid continued stress on Ethereum's network.Messari data shows the MATIC price has risen by 40% in the past 24 hours, hitting 6.5-week highs above $0.50, for a 25-fold gain on a year-to-date basis. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, was up 6% over the past 24 hours, while No. 2 ether surged 10%.MATIC, now with a market capitalization of more than $2.5 billion, rose about 5% in price last week, defying a sell-off in cryptocurrencies as markets digested the prospects of U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed capital gains tax hike. If passed, the measure could dampen demand for riskier investment assets, including bitcoin as well as other fast-moving digital assets.  Polygon's organic growth is powering its price higher, Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain data company Nansen, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Polygon has seen 10x rise in the number of transactions since the start of the year,"" Svanevik said. ""That's a significant increase.""Record activity on Ethereum has led to network congestion and high transaction costs this year. The dynamic in turn has driven an increase in demand for alternative ""smart-contact"" blockchain networks, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC), along with scaling projects like Polygon that provide faster and cheaper transactions using layer 2 sidechains. These are tangential networks running alongside the main Ethereum blockchain.In recent weeks, Polygon has won increasing adoption, with top names from the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) announcing integration with the layer 2 scaling solution in a bid to bypass congestion and high fees on Ethereum's network. ""Polygon, the top Ethereum layer 2 is going nuts! Integrations with Aave, Pooltogether, Sushiswap, Open Sea, Curve Finance, Decentraland, and loads of other big #defi applications,"" market analyst Lark Davis tweeted Sunday. The Aave-Polygon integration announced March 31 has already brought over $1 billion in liquidity into Aave protocol, according to a tweet from Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic. Aave was the third-largest DeFi protocol at press time, with $6.33 billion in ""total value locked"" (TVL), which is the amount of collateral put into the system in exchange for loans or other transactions. The investor community is cheering the outlook for lower fees resulting from Aave's decision to adopt Polygon. ""Being able to interact with Aave without worrying about gas fees is a game-changer,"" one user tweeted. ""Now I understand why Aave is the powerhouse of DeFi."" Bjelic predicted that other DeFi protocols would see Aave-like growth.Curve Finance adopted Polygon's scaling solution earlier this month, saying that Polygon's high-speed and low-cost infrastructure is the perfect match for its mission to allow for seamless exchange of stablecoins.""Scaling narrative is accelerating, courtesy of Polygon and its layer-2 aggregator vision,"" Denis Vinkourov, head of research at the trading sentiment data provider Trade the Chain, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""The popular saying, 'Build it, and they will come,' couldn't be any more relevant after the likes of Curve and Aave announced support"" for Polygon. ""Looking ahead, it's not just Polygon that will continue to attract new capital, but so will decentralized exchanges such as QuickSwap,"" Vinokourov said. ",2021-04-26
3783,"Bitcoin (BTC) is holding support above $50,000 after reaching oversold levels last week. The cryptocurrency was trading around $53,400 at press time. The next resistance level is roughly 8% higher, around $58,000.",2021-04-26
3784,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) allows strangers on the internet to earn money much the same way bankers do, by earning fees on financial services.In most cases, people do that by providing liquidity. Those investors “stake,” or lend, digital currencies, not dollars or euros or yen, and they are lending the digital currencies to apps rather than to people or companies. One set of apps with the most need for liquidity and the heaviest flow of transactions is decentralized exchanges (DEXs), particularly automated market makers (AMMs) led by Uniswap.But how does anyone decide which AMM is the right one for their funds?This post is a starting point for each investor in the almost $60 billion DeFi market to begin doing their own research on which exchange to take part in. Joining a particular DeFi community can mean much more than just putting up funds. It can also mean participating in discussions, helping out new users, voting on governance decisions and even writing suggested improvements for a software protocol's code base.It's surprising that the industry has even reached this point. Not so long ago, there was doubt about how practical it was to decentralize cryptocurrency exchanges. Besides dealing with slow execution speeds, traders on DEXs were vulnerable to front-runners stealing their smartest trades. And yet here we are. Decentralized applications that many CoinDesk readers will have heard of, such as Uniswap, Curve and SushiSwap, are all now in the top 10 decentralized applications as ranked by DeFi Pulse. Just on its own, Uniswap's worst week so far in 2021 was $5.8 billion in volume, usually coming in somewhere like $8 billion a week since mid-February, according to its own stats. In fact, Uniswap's creator, Hayden Adams, just announced that his app had posted $10 billion in a week for the first time ever.Once a sector is putting up numbers like that, there's no need to compare it with similar fields any longer. AMMs have become a respectable business on their own. Even if they never grew from here, it would be worthwhile to a lot of people to be part of such a market.But they do need to entice investors to join.Facebook is terrible, but we all keep opening the app because everyone is there. That's also why no one leaves, even though we all wish we could. One could say Facebook has social liquidity.DEXs work much the same way. The exchanges work better the more liquidity they have on hand, and so they compete as much on providing attractive deals for liquidity providers (LPs) as they do on being affordable and easy for traders.So, for those considering putting some of their crypto assets to work by becoming an LP, what follows is something like a map of the various automated market makers of significance out there so far. It's not a comprehensive guide, and it's definitely not meant to do anything like help investors decide which place will make them more money.This map, again, is a starting point for deciding which community an investor might want to get involved in. Because this is DeFi; once you are in, you are part of it. It's not like buying some Enron stock and seeing where it goes. Backers of these platforms have a voice, and they work best when a lot of them use it.Each of these applications is part of a specific ecosystem, and each represents a specific vision of the future. Potential backers of such protocols should understand that vision and decide whether to buy it. That's where, we hope, this post can help.Why it mattersDEXs struggled as long as the market was led by exchanges that attempted to imitate the experience of a centralized crypto exchange like Binance or Kraken. It was the advent of the AMM that allowed DEXs to gain a foothold.For a great overall explainer that gets into the mechanics of how AMMs work, Haseeb Qureshi did a deep dive on his blog last year that really gets into some of the harder-to-grasp concepts.Here's the core insight of the AMM: Users don't trade against another person – they trade with the smart contract, a type of software program. An AMM is always willing to buy and always willing to sell at a stated price.The basic AMM works as a series of pools of two assets (say, ETH, the foundational currency of the Ethereum blockchain,  and DAI, an Ethereum token designed to hold its value against the U.S. dollar). The price offered by the AMM does not reference the external world. In the simplest form, it's just a function of the ratio of the two assets. So if there were 1 ETH in the pool and 2,000 DAI, 1 DAI would cost 0.0005 ETH and 1 ETH would cost 2,000 DAI.However if someone bought 0.01 ETH for 20 DAI, then the price would change; now a DAI would be 0.000495 ETH. A tiny change, but the shift gets bigger with bigger trades. Each trade changes the underlying price. A big trade would knock a pool out of line with other markets, but arbitrageurs can be relied on to trade it so it's back in line; that's not a bug, but a feature.Furthermore, an AMM with enough token pairs can trade between any two tokens listed, even if those two tokens aren't in the same pool. A user can trade BAT for ZRX, for example, by trading BAT for ETH and then ETH for ZRX, all in one transaction in the Metamask software wallet. Very smooth.This is the core idea pioneered by Bancor and then brought to a much wider market by Uniswap. Now that that basic idea has proven itself as a workable business model, each of the stronger AMMs has developed its own iteration.Understanding those iterations can help a potential liquidity provider understand which DEX squares with their worldview.""A lot of these are functionally the same from a tech perspective,"" said Will Price, a DeFi investor active in this area. ""It's just a difference in community and a difference in what they choose to incentivize about yield farming""In what follows, we describe each protocol for a liquidity provider. They all follow the same pattern, describing each of the following where applicable:This post is not, by the way, really about trading on these applications. Traders are moving to using services like 1inch, Slingshot and Matcha that automate finding the best rates across DEXs. This is about deciding where to make a deposit.Uniswap remains the clear market leader. As of this writing, it has $6 billion worth of liquidity committed in the protocol according to DeFi Pulse, making it the third-largest app in DeFi.Uniswap just announced version 3.0, which considerably refines the notion of an LP in an AMM. Big picture,with this new version, Uniswap signaled that it's laser focused on being the best AMM, full stop. It's not trying to expand into other areas of DeFi. Instead, it wants to continue to lead in its niche.The new version is slated to launch May 5.The new version solves the problem of so-called wasted liquidity. This can be a little tough to grasp, but let's give it a shot.Remember how we wrote above that each trade shifts the price in an AMM pool? More accurately, the price shifts even within a trade.Most of the time that doesn't really matter, but if someone trades a significant amount of funds in one pool, an amount that has a meaningful impact on the price of the pool, their final price for the trade will actually be an average of a series of prices.So in our example above, imagine a pool that started with 1 ETH and 2,000 DAI. If someone wanted to buy 0.5 ETH, the trade would throw the price of ETH and DAI wildly out of whack with the larger market. In fact, it would be so severe that it's unlikely that anyone would ever make such a large trade.So, if no one is ever willing to make trades that use most of the liquidity on one side of any pool, that also means that no one would ever buy nearly as much ETH as sits in the whole pool nor nearly as much DAI. Only a portion of it is ever likely to be traded, and so there is wasted liquidity.""How capital-efficient do you want your position to be?” Price said. “Most tokens in a Uniswap pool don't actually get touched, because you're providing liquidity from negative infinity to positive infinity."" So Uniswap's next version will create a different system, one in which a liquidity provider can define a range of the AMM curve at which they will participate. If the price falls outside of that range, their liquidity just sits it out. That might sound like wasted liquidity, but people are going to load up in the part of the curve where trades are most likely. So it actually means there will be a lot more liquidity.That has the impact of allowing traders to make much larger trades within the normal expected range of a given pair.Stablecoins provide the easiest example of why this is powerful. One USDC should generally trade for 1 DAI, because both are pegged to the dollar. Yet in a simple AMM, a big trade can knock the prices for the two widely off the mark. With Uniswap version 3.0, though, a trader will be able to define their liquidity as only participating in trades where DAI sells for no more than 1.01 and no less than 0.99 USDC. If they put in $1 million of liquidity with that parameter, then a trader could be guaranteed a trade of, say, $500,000, with slippage no greater than a penny.It should be noted that this arrangement will very strongly favor the most sophisticated market makers. For small investors looking to make passive income, Uniswap could be tough, but the change would be good for all traders, including small ones.The new version could also have spillover effects on other platforms.""The existence of these concentrated liquidity positions means the best execution of the trades is going to wind up on Uniswap a bigger portion of the time,"" Price said. ""The returns to passive LPs in other systems are going to go down.""That said, several market sources said they expect startups to come along that take retail investors’ assets and actively deploy them on Uniswap, so that normal people can once again set it and forget it on the leading DEX.If Ethereum were comparable to personal computing, then Uniswap up to now has been like the DOS era, where any decently adept hacker could code up something others might use. The new Uniswap version seems tantamount to the Mac/Windows era: easier for everyone to make use of but a tougher environment for individuals and tiny teams to build in.Other featuresThe upshot of these customizable pools is that it also would enable clever traders to put in orders to buy at certain prices if they get hit. So, for example, a trader could plan ahead to ""buy the dip."" Uniswap is calling these ""ranged pools.""Uniswap enabled flash swaps in version 2.0 (in other words, an entire pool of a token can be borrowed for the length of one Ethereum transaction). It also introduced an oracle, or external data source for settling bets, with version 2.0, which it promises will be even better in version 3.0. Lastly, Uniswap will allow LPs to customize fees somewhat on pools in version three, so they could, for example, charge a higher fee on less frequently traded pairs.Fun fact about v3: Pool accounting will no longer be done with ERC-20 tokens, a common type of asset created on Ethereum. Instead, each stake will be unique and tracked using Ethereum's non-fungible tokens standard, which spawned the recent NFT craze. That will make the LP tokens less composable in the immediate term, meaning it will be harder to mix and match them like Legos to build innovative money applications. But no doubt entrepreneurs will soon find clever ways to make use of the new NFTs.CommunityUniswap was the last of the big AMMs to release a so-called governance token. But when it did, “airdropping” UNI as a sort of participation award to every past user, it was probably one of the biggest moments in DeFi for 2020, which was already an historic year.While Uniswap briefly ran a liquidity mining program to further distribute UNI as a bonus for liquidity providers in key pools, it was discontinued as planned and has not been renewed. Smart money would probably bet on a new distribution coming along to encourage migration from v2 to v3 pools.While UNI has appreciated considerably in price, as a governance token it has had little influence so far. There have been only three proposals on Uniswap on which UNI holders could vote. Two failed and one, creating a small community grantmaking program from the UNI treasury, succeeded on Dec. 26.Uniswap is a venture capital-backed company, one that appears designed to enable its core team to retain control of it for quite a while longer. It requires at least 4% of UNI to vote in any governance decision for the final decision to be effective. Failure to reach such a quorum is what doomed the two unsuccessful measures.That desire for control for a time is also reflected in Uniswap’s decision not to immediately make version 3.0 of its software open-source, or free for anyone to copy and modify.SushiSwap has a reputation as the community-powered AMM.Whereas Uniswap is the AMM for insiders, SushiSwap has opened itself up to the wider world, and never stopped shelling out governance tokens (ticker symbol: SUSHI) to its liquidity providers.SushiSwap took its place in DeFi by force, stealing the limelight from Uniswap just long enough to create what seems to be a lasting place for itself in DeFi.If the “DeFi Summer of 2020” had been a novel, SushiSwap's debut would have been the final act, covering the last few chapters. Using a clever construct that's come to be referred to as ""vampire mining,"" the Sushi chefs convinced Uniswap LPs to turn over their tokens to its control and let the protocol move all their assets to SushiSwap.The plan worked. SushiSwap managed to hoover up a chunk of value locked in Uniswap. It was a whole thing, as the kids say.Here was a weird part, though: After SushiSwap ended the extraction of funds from Uniswap's pools, Uniswap actually had more assets under its control than it had when the struggle started.When the dust settled, Uniswap was back on top, SushiSwap had different leadership and had fallen considerably in the rankings. The drop in SUSHI rewards and then the debut of UNI caused funds to come rushing back to the O.G. AMM.For a short time, it looked like SushiSwap would become an interesting footnote in DeFi history, but it wasn't so. It's often said that ""community is everything"" in crypto, though it usually comes off as rhetoric.However, beneath the mists swirling in a typhoon of degens chasing yield over Ethereum's blocks and snatching up free space money as if they were playing a game of Temple Run, a team of talented developers and business people were settling in at SushiSwap.SushiSwap has since distinguished itself in a few ways, and now has almost $4 billion in total value locked (TVL) in it, as of this writing.""If you're reading their Medium posts and their updates, the team is building in a very interesting direction,"" said Santiago Roel, a partner at ParaFi Capital. ""It's definitely innovating and moving in a direction different than Uniswap.""Unique featuresSushiSwap has been actively helping new, small token projects get traction by promoting them through its Onsen system. Onsen pays out extra rewards in SUSHI for those who stake to it. This helps attract new users and builds loyalty to SushiSwap as certain projects find their footing.""Some coins are only initiated on SushiSwap,"" said Jason Choi, general partner at Spartan Capital.To be fair, coins also launch on Uniswap, but they don't get a special deal out of it. Onsen has been a business development strategy for SushiSwap, and it appears to have been fruitful.And while Uniswap laser focuses on its role as an exchange, SushiSwap is expanding into other areas of DeFi. It recently released Bento Box, a pool of capital that other DeFi apps can plug into. The first app on Bento is Kashi, a lending protocol that limits risk for collateral providers.On an obvious level, marrying a lending facility with an exchange creates options for leveraged long positions or shorts, but we may see even more creative trades before long.""I think their niche is, they ship periphery products very quickly. SushiSwap is more focused on building products around the core products,"" Choi said. Version 3.0 is well underway.Lastly, SushiSwap has eagerly deployed itself on other platforms, including parallel “layer-2” networks for Ethereum and entirely other blockchains. That hasn’t proven to be a major driver of activity yet, but it is a way in which SushiSwap has a lead should some other blockchain gain traction.""I find it interesting when teams deploy on other chains,"" Roel said, but ""I don't think they've found meaningful traction""Additional yieldUniswap and SushiSwap have the same trading fees, but crucially, SushiSwap never stopped its liquidity mining program. Users who stake their LP tokens on SushiSwap's ""Sushi Bar"" earn SUSHI continuously. The ability to drive additional earnings makes SUSHI attractive above and beyond its governance powers. By contrast, for now, UNI does not earn anything.CommunityThe fact that SUSHI earns revenue isn't its only feature. It also has been driving a decent amount of governance activity.SushiSwap moves through quite a few proposals, as can be seen on its voting page.BentoBox is a good example: It was an idea that came from a community member. Once it was greenlit, he built it and now that it's up, he will earn a small piece of all its fees.Curve is the protocol that beat Uniswap on stablecoins.It's the second biggest AMM, measured by TVL on Defi Pulse. It's conducting $286 million in trading volume per day.Curve Finance constructed a new formula for its AMM, specifically for pools with pairs of tokens that should travel basically in sync with each other. The price of the stablecoins, USDC and DAI and USDT and TUSD, should be generally 1:1, with tiny variations, because they are all designed to follow the price of the U.S. dollar. Similarly, WBTC and renBTC also should travel pretty much in lockstep, because they both ape bitcoin.With that in mind, Curve was built so that the price curve really only started moving out of step on the far outer edges of the liquidity bands.It is also worth noting that Curve's early days coincided with Yearn Finance's early days.Yearn Finance is a robo-advisor for yield that has become big, complex and touches on every corner of DeFi. Early on, though, its creator, Andre Cronje, was focused almost exclusively on stablecoins. Cronje liked that there were lots of opportunities for yield on Ethereum, but he didn't want to mess with worrying about token volatility. So he stuck to playing with stablecoins in the early days. That made Yearn and Curve naturally simpatico. One key difference with Curve's design versus Uniswap or SusiSwap is that it handles pools with multiple tokens more easily (Balancer, the DeFi portfolio manager, also does that). That made Curve useful to Yearn, because it had strategies for users to earn returns on all the major stablecoins, DAI, USDC, USDT and TUSD. Receipts for deposits in those strategies yielded tokens with names like yDAI and yUSDC.So, Curve created a pool to make it easy to switch between these four pools. Additionally, users who intend to HODL a given Yearn token can still deposit it in Curve's liquidity and earn transaction fees.Cronje likes to call himself ""Batman for yield,"" and in some ways, Curve has been his Robin. In the comics, the original Robin went on to become a superhero in his own right. To that end, though, Curve has established a niche in trading tokens that are non-volatile (relative to each other). “We have pools for volatile pairs finishing the last audit,"" said founder Michael Egorov. Which means Curve is ready to face off with the other AMMs directly.Unique featuresAs we spoke to Egorov, about Curve recently, he explained that this is one of Curve's big ideas: meta-pools. Curve likes to run pools-of-pools (it can really get quite dizzying).It has also shown itself willing to chase opportunities beyond Ethereum. Curve just launched a version on the Ethereum L2 known as Matic. In February, it announced plans to go on Polkadot, one of the largest blockchains by market capitalization but still quite new and close but not quite fully functional.Additional yieldSimilar to SushiSwap, Curve users can boost yield by earning its governance token, CRV. Curve had a surprise launch for its liquidity mining program last August.That liquidity mining program remains active and is built to continue roughly 300 more years. It has an exponential decay design that, Egorov argues, compares favorably to Bitcoin. (The last unit of the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies is expected to be mined in 2140 or so.)Liquidity providers in Curve pools can earn CRV, but they have to stake their LP tokens in Curve's ""gauge."" Curve calls it a gauge because it gives more CRV to people who have staked longer. This reporter tried the gauge once, and the transaction fees to do so were so high, we never staked.""In general, if you're deploying a few hundred dollars, it might not be worth it for a lot of farms,"" Choi said. ""A lot of the smaller retail guys are basically priced out of this game. If you look on-chain, you see a lot of very chunky deposits.""So, it might not make sense to go this route casually. Try to research in advance how much it will cost in fees before going in. It takes several transactions, and so it's not enough just to check Metamask.CommunityThe main governance activity for CRV holders is deciding how much CRV is earned by LPs for different pools. That is one of the ways the community entices new liquidity onto the platform. For example, when UST was becoming popular on Ethereum, the returns on the pool early on were extremely high as they tried to get the pool filled up. As it did, though, and the CRV spread out over more holdings, the returns became more reasonable.Curve's governance system is complex. It's not the CRV itself that votes, for example. By staking, accounts accrue veCRV, which has no value except that it can be used to vote.If that isn't already clear, there are a lot of fiddly details with Curve, but some folks are really into that.Bancor has made a big comeback.No one disputes that Bancor pioneered the basic AMM model, but through all of 2020, when a Uniswap fork, or splinter project, was able to break multiple billions in liquidity, Bancor had numbers stuck in the low millions, as tracked by DeFi Pulse. That turned around late in the year though, and now Bancor sits just outside of DeFi's top 10.The new version now has some real advantages for LPs.First of all, Bancor offers single-sided liquidity, which is unique in the sector. ""Single-side liquidity provision is pretty good for user experience,"" Choi said.Most automated market makers require a user to enter with two cryptocurrencies, equal in dollar value. Some AMMs will automate swapping half of a deposit for the other cryptocurrency on the fly, but that costs the LP in on-chain computation, or “gas,” fees.Bancor doesn't do that. Instead, Bancor will simply mint the required amount of the other currency, because the other currency is always its Bancor Network Token (BNT).When an AMM pairs every currency with the same other currency, it makes it easy to make transfers between any two listed tokens. If a user wants to trade WBTC for BAT, Bancor can just swap WBTC for BNT and then BNT for BAT. To the user, it looks like one transaction. The common token is like a conductor.Bancor's approach to single-sided liquidity is worth dwelling on for a moment. When Bancor's first token sale was announced, Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer argued that there was no good reason for Bancor to use a new token when it could have just used ETH as the common token. Indeed, that's what Hayden Adams did when he created v1 of Uniswap and it worked amazingly well. That approach made Uniswap the dominant AMM.(With version 2.0, Uniswap opened it up to allow any two tokens to be paired, knowing there would be enough pairs that a path could always be found.)But here's the twist: Bancor can opt to make changes to its own token. It can't change ETH. So now the Bancor protocol can mint BNT as needed to take the other half of any deposit in the pool. Bancor refers to this as co-investing with LPs.Basically, all BNT holders pay a little as the supply expands for each new LP, but it's probably worth it because more LPs make Bancor work better, which means more demand for BNT. That should be good for the price in the long term. The most obvious concern here would be the impact all that minting would have on BNT’s price for its holders in the short-term, but BNT has done great over the last year. The real test will be what happens when the overall market is a little calmer. Bancor's also got a program for creating deflationary pressure on the token with a portion of fees.Unique featuresWhile single-sided liquidity seems savvy, Bancor's claim to fame in some corners is its approach to the hobgoblin of AMM LPs: impermanent loss.Impermanent loss is one of the most head-scratchy terms in DeFi. It's a particular danger in AMMs.""You can't get rid of impermanent loss. You can mitigate it,"" Roel cautioned.In simple language, AMMs prices are typically expressed through a simple ratio of the two assets. That means that when one asset appreciates dramatically and another doesn't, that pool will end up with less of the asset that appreciated and more of the one that's staying flat (because it needs more of the less valuable asset to equal the value of the appreciating asset on the other side).We saw that a lot in the early days of the bull run, with BTC appreciating and ETH not really moving. So a WBTC (wrapped Bitcoin)/ETH pool in Uniswap would lose WBTC to ETH as more ETH would be needed to equal the value of WBTC on the other side.The problem is a lot of times that means the value of your portion of a pool will lose in dollar value even though it's been earning trading fees. When redeeming LP tokens on an AMM, an LP doesn't necessarily get the same quantities of tokens back. They get their share of the pool back.In a two-stablecoin pool, say DAI/USDT, the value of that share is unlikely to really change (except in trading fee yield). In a WBTC/ETH pool, that can change a lot, and potentially in a direction unfavorable to the LP. Impermanent loss is called impermanent loss because a lot of times it evaporates if the LP just waits long enough. But sometimes people need to get out and it can be painful.To go through this with numbers and moving graphs, the Qureshi post mentioned above is good.Bancor built an insurance policy. Users who suffer impermanent loss on Bancor are guaranteed to be made whole in terms of the value of their initial deposit as long as they stay in for at least 100 days.The difference is made up in BNT (Thorchain, below, does the same thing, with its native token, RUNE).One could argue that users are just trading the cost of impermanent loss with the cost of lost flexibility, but for some projects that go into pools with the intention of sticking around over the long haul, that guarantee can be appealing.""What I've observed is some teams, like Yearn, find that interesting. From that standpoint, that becomes compelling,"" Roel said.Circling back to Uniswap, impermanent loss is also part of the motivation behind allowing LPs to define their trading band for a pool. A user won't suffer impermanent loss if their funds go outside a band that would go against them.Bancor also just launched limit orders. Basically, a user can call a trade in advance if he thinks something is going to happen. For example: ""Buy ETH if it drops below 1800 DAI in the next 30 days."" That kind of thing. It's an extremely common feature on centralized exchanges but not built directly into many AMMs, mainly because traders sophisticated enough to use limit orders are using trade aggregators, such as the aforementioned Matcha and 1inch, that handle that kind of issue for them.Bancor is also a multichain project. Its decentralized application (dapp), known as BancorX, allows swaps between the EOS and Ethereum networks.Additional yieldLPs that commit their trading fees back into the pools can earn increased rewards over time, encouraging LPs to stick around longer.CommunityBancor governance happens through the Bancor DAO (decentralized autonomous organizations), which has been evolving fast. The governance token is a derivative of its network token, BNT, called vBNT, which can be earned by staking. The governance model's latest iteration only kicked in at the end of March. (Founders were not exactly rushing to start DAOs in 2017 when Bancor ran its record-breaking initial coin offering).Thorchain is the one of only two AMMs on this list that isn't on Ethereum.There's not a lot of AMM activity outside of Ethereum. There's not a lot of anything but hodling outside of Ethereum. It remains to be seen what will happen with Thorchain. It is very, very new.""I wouldn't be comfortable putting liquidity into it yet,"" Price cautioned.Thorchain is worth mentioning because it takes a completely different approach to settlement than any of the blockchains above; it trades between blockchains. Uniswap, Curve, Sushi and Bancor are all on blockchains. They trade around tokens within that blockchain. Some can execute trades between separate blockchains, but they use workarounds and hacks to do it.Thorchain has its own blockchain, natively designed to operate across multiple architectures. Like Bancor, it uses a common token (RUNE) in order to make trades, for example, between BTC and ETH, but unlike Bancor it doesn't need to offer users a wrapped (synthetic) version of either. A trader can put BTC into Thorchain from their wallet and get ETH paid out to an ETH wallet.Unique featuresLike Bancor, Thorchain offers an impermanent loss guarantee for deposits held more than 100 days. When we spoke to Thorchain’s team before its launch, they said their models showed that there's hardly any such losses for people who hold that long, but you know the old saying: Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.Additional yieldRUNE is a governance token as well as a utility token on the network. Users earn newly emitted RUNE for serving as LPs. CommunityThose governance tokens will be important sooner than folks might be ready, because the mostly anonymous team behind Thorchain has committed to completely stepping down from the project during the next year, turning further developments over to RUNE token holders.The project has a considerable treasury as RUNE has appreciated dramatically in price. It could go any number of directions, but the first order of business is adding cryptocurrencies to its exchange as fast as it safely can. Even as it announced its first handful (bitcoin, ETH, litecoin, bitcoin cash and Binance's BNB), many others were well under way in development.""One good thing about crypto transactions is they cost the same whether it's $10 or $10 million. For hedge funds and whales, these transactions are negligible,"" Price said.There's another way to make fees fairly negligible, though: Leave Ethereum.As we write this, Coingecko ranks PancakeSwap as the largest DEX of them all, crediting it with $4.5 billion in daily trade volume. The website Defistation credits it with $7 billion in TVL.PancakeSwap, like SushiSwap, is a fork of Uniswap, built for Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which uses the BNB token much in the same way Ethereum uses ETH.""Currently they have well over 100 pairs of assets,"" Choi said. ""There's quite a lot of new projects launching on Binance Smart Chain.""BSC is more centralized, with only 21 validators leading the chain, using a system much like EOS. That makes BSC faster and cheaper to use, but considerably more vulnerable to tampering by third parties.According to Choi, that tradeoff is just fine for many users.""It's a faster chain,” he said. “The retail [investors] don't actually care that much about decentralization.”BSC is compatible with Ethereum's code logic, making it easy for forks of successful Ethereum projects to be run on BSC. PancakeSwap is a case in point.But the AMM also ground to a halt in mid-April. Transactions were too much of a good thing:Additional yieldAs with the other AMMs, PancakeSwap liquidity providers earn fees on trades within pools they have participated in. Since volumes on PancakeSwap are very high and transaction fees are much lower, that should create more activity that will enable participants to generate more yield.Like on SushiSwap, LPs who stake their positions will earn a governance token, CAKE.CommunityPancakeSwap's governance is quite active via its snapshot page. It is largely oriented around approving boosted CAKE rewards for new pools, as a way of generating early liquidity and interest from users, much like SushiSwap's Onsen program.It also just let CAKE holders decide how to change the transaction fees and how to allocate them.Launching projects with what are known as initial exchange offerings is still quite popular outside the U.S. and with every dapp on Ethereum available for duplication, there's plenty of new dapps to offer.If this was a lot to take in, get ready. It's only going to get bigger and more complicated. This is an exciting time for someone ready to do some research and thinking, because getting involved in all of this craziness makes it make sense faster.That will be very advantageous, because it will prepare LPs to better understand (and perhaps profit from) the new wrinkles as they come. And they will come. They will come fast.",2021-04-26
3785,"Bitcoin rose for the first time in six days, climbing past $52,000 as bulls pushed prices higher in early Asia trading hours Monday.In a rally that appeared to start around 22:00 UTC (6 p.m. ET) on Sunday, bitcoin (BTC) bounced off a seven-week low around $47,655, subsequently printing some of its largest hourly gains in two days.The bellwether cryptocurrency was changing hands around $52,100 as of 2:16 UTC Monday, with buyer volume at the highest hourly levels since April 23.Traders are speculating whether bitcoin might be correcting. Prices tumbled last week by the most since February, amid concern that U.S. President Joe Biden’s proposal to raise the capital-gains tax on cryptocurrencies and other investments might weigh on the market.On the technical side, bitcoin's relative strength index – an indicator used to gauge trend momentum – shows the cryptocurrency is attempting a daily timeframe bounce from levels of oversold at 30.00 on April 25.Other major cryptocurrencies were also in the green, gaining an average 3.7% on the day. Uniswap's UNI token posted some of the biggest gains, rising more than 14% over the last 24 hours.In traditional markets, Asian stock indexes were mixed and fairly muted with the Hang Seng Index up around 1.1%.

3786,"Bitcoin's volatility has been moving in a downward direction, and the price of the currency seems fixed in a band between $50,000 and $60,000. Is the current market for bitcoin a temporary lull between lurches? Or is it a long-term trend toward lower volatility that could change the way bitcoin is perceived?The answer is, it's too early to tell. The chart above shows bitcoin's volatility has been on a steady decline. (Ether and the S&P 500 are included as references.) However, it's still in an approximate mid-range, historically. As of Sunday morning, this past week's correction hadn't changed that. Bitcoin's price remains roughly in a band between $50,000 and $60,000, and with this week's dip marking the second time it's rocked between the minimum and maximum of that range, its volatility is still roughly in the middle.Using the table below as a guide, bitcoin's stretch of middling volatility is likely to continue. At 43 days, it is still rather young, as these things go. The data in the table is based on dividing bitcoin volatility into three ranges: high, mid and low. High is volatility at or above 100%. Mid is volatility at or above 50%, and below 100%. Low is volatility below 50%. Volatility is the 30-day standard deviation of daily log returns, annualized at 365 days of trading. These ranges aren't entirely arbitrary. Since October 2014, bitcoin volatility's top tercile has been above 79% and its middle third has started at 51%. Looking at bitcoin volatility in this way shows a pattern in the duration of volatility cycles. In the first two years on the table, bitcoin volatility cycles tended to be shorter, less than 50 days in duration. They lengthened in 2016 to 2018, then returned to shorter cycles in 2019. As of Saturday, bitcoin's volatility was just over 50%, putting it at the low end of our mid-range for volatility. It's been in the mid-range for 43 days, following a period (32 days) of high volatility that ended March 13. In the current environment, it hasn't yet reached the average duration of a volatility cycle – at least not as we're defining them here. If recent norms persist, bitcoin's volatility may be disappointing both to traders antsy for a break and technologists hoping for long-term, lower volatility that could make bitcoin more ""useful"" as a currency. It may feel like bitcoin has been in stasis for a long time, but historically speaking this could be a long haul.– Galen MooreThis week saw two notable appointments that underline the “institutionalization” of crypto markets:We continue to see investment pour into crypto market infrastructure from traditional investment firms. This past week:Coinbase will list the stablecoin tether (USDT) on its professional trading platform, allowing investors to deposit immediately and to begin trading next week. TAKEAWAY: This move is a big deal, as it effectively legitimizes tether, which had been struggling with reputation issues related to the stablecoin’s backing and the internal handling of funds. Earlier this year, the NYAG settled its enquiry into the stablecoin’s issuing company and sister exchange, mandating periodic attestations starting in May 2021. Tether acts as a significant support to market liquidity, and concerns that regulatory or confidence problems could deal a blow to overall market sentiment have been weighing on the market for some time. That Coinbase’s first new token listing after going public should be a stablecoin previously mired in controversy sends a strong signal of support to the market’s preference for a competitor to the USDC stablecoin, which is managed by a Circle-Coinbase partnership.New York-based Signature Bank added $3.77 billion in non-interest bearing deposits in Q1, which shows an acceleration of deposit growth – in Q4 the growth was $2.5 billion. TAKEAWAY: Figures like these will signal to other banks that the crypto industry is currently a source of strong balance sheet growth and could encourage more of them to offer service to crypto companies. Over the years, crypto companies have struggled to get basic banking services, a more robust banking service offering for crypto companies, perhaps even competition for their business, will bring new operating efficiencies. That, in turn, will make these companies even more attractive to investors, which will further support innovation.Cryptocurrency-focused financial services firm Galaxy Digital is in advanced discussions to buy crypto custodian BitGo, according to sources. TAKEAWAY: Yet another gripping scoop from my colleague Ian Allison. Whether it goes ahead or not, this represents powerful positioning in the crypto prime broker race.San Francisco-based trading tech firm X-Margin and cryptocurrency custody provider Fireblocks are developing a credit management system that gives lenders insight into borrower positions across platforms while preserving privacy. TAKEAWAY: This is intriguing in that it brings a technology angle to the prime brokerage business, with the potential effect of reducing lending risk and collateral requirements, which in turn should free up liquidity.A bitcoin ETF managed by 3iQ and CoinShares is now trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbols BTCQ (CAD) and BTCQ.U (USD). TAKEAWAY: For those keeping score, Canada now has four bitcoin exchange-traded funds and four ether ETFs. The U.S. still has none.Speaking of 3iQ, the company’s CEO told Bloomberg that it is aiming to raise over $200 million from the dual listing of its 3iQ Coinshares bitcoin exchange-traded fund in Dubai. TAKEAWAY: The potential is indeed high, since it will be the first cryptocurrency fund to go public in the Middle East. Switzerland-based investment product provider 21Shares is launching exchange-traded products (ETPs) for the native cryptocurrencies of Stellar (ticker: AXLM) and Cardano (ticker: AADA) on the Swiss SIX Exchange. TAKEAWAY: It’s curious that Europe has such a wide range of crypto-based assets listed on exchanges that investors of all types can access through their brokers, while the U.S. has none. (Unless you count MicroStrategy, but that’s a different story.)Bitcoin services firm NYDIG has bought commercial lender Arctos Capital, which provides financing solutions to bitcoin miners and other crypto firms. TAKEAWAY: It is fascinating to see the growing institutional interest in the bitcoin mining industry, which points not only to greater sophistication in mining financing and operations, but also to considerable growth ahead in North American mining operations.– Noelle Acheson",2021-04-25
3787,"Valkyrie Digital Assets is getting ready to launch its bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) filed a 19B-4 Form on behalf of the investment firm for its bitcoin ETF late on Friday. The form kicked off a 45-day review period when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledges the filing.  During that time, the SEC has to either approve or disapprove the application, or extend the review period.“This is something that I’ve wanted to do for five years now,” said Steven McClurg, chief investment officer of Valkyrie Investments. “It wasn’t until recently that I believed that the SEC would probably approve a bitcoin ETF. So we started working on that in earnest probably in August.”The SEC has rejected every bitcoin ETF application, but Gary Gensler, the SEC's new chairman, could change the regulator’s attitude to the novel investment product. Gensler is a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman who taught crypto and blockchain courses at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In January, Dalia Blass, the director of the SEC’s division of investment management, left the agency. In 2018, Blass wrote a letter expressing concerns that the bitcoin market wasn't large enough or liquid enough to be ready for an exchange-traded product. Several firms have applied for a bitcoin ETF in anticipation of the new administration. Earlier in March, Valkyrie proposed an ETF that would invest the majority of its capital into companies that have bitcoin on their balance sheets or are otherwise connected to crypto, and it filed a registration proposal called Valkyrie Bitcoin Trust in January. Valkyrie is the at least the fourth firm to file a 19B-4, following VanEck, which filed one in March  and had its 19B-4 acknowledged by the SEC on March 18. The SEC is also reviewing WisdomTree and Kryptoin’s ETF applications.",2021-04-23
3788,"The value of the cryptocurrency market declined by hundreds of billions of dollars Friday but seems to be recovering at the close of the business week.The price of bitcoin fell over the past 24 hours, with the asset dipping as low as $47,875 around 09:00 GMT (4 a.m. ET) according to CoinDesk 20 data. The price is now retrenching from the loss, at around $50,993 as of press time. Analysts pointed to U.S. President Joe Biden’s proposal to double capital gains taxes on high-income individuals as the catalyst. “My take right now is that the Joe Biden tax has something to do with it. Sellers probably jammed the market, and bids disappeared,” said Consantine Kogan, partner at investment firm Wave Financial. “U.S. participants are just a portion of the market but probably the wealthiest, both corporate and retail.” “Bitcoin broke the $50,000 support, going back to early March price levels with a drawdown of 25%,” noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. “Holding ground at $50,000 would confirm the accumulation pattern by institutional investors at or below $50,000, leaving room to grow for bitcoin in the coming weeks and months.”Bitcoin had been in the doldrums for most of the week while alternative cryptocurrencies shined as recently as Thursday. But no asset was completely spared during the recent fall. Total crypto market capitalization, as provided by charting software TradingView, fell from $2 trillion to as low as $1.7 trillion, a $300 billion plunge that exemplifies the fickle nature of blockchain-based assets. As of press time, total cryptocurrency market cap is recovering but still down 1.7% over the past 24 hours. As usual, liquidations, the crypto market equivalent of a margin call on Wall Street, exacerbated the price drop. According to data aggregator Bybt, over $3.4 billion in long liquidations occurred across all cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours.The tumble began late Thursday in the U.S. equities markets, with the S&P 500 falling 0.80% Thursday. Not long after the U.S. market closed, bitcoin began its slide below $50,000. Darius Sit, partner at quantitative trading firm QCP Capital, noted that larger macro events, such as the fear of higher taxes on traders and investors, cause most markets to work in tandem. “When there is a deleveraging event, everything is correlated,” he told CoinDesk. Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment firm Tellurian Capital, highlighted $50,000 per BTC as a key market price point as taxes might still stay front and center in market dynamics over the next month or so. “We are still seeing good BTC support at $50,000,” Bonnefous told CoinDesk via a Telegram message. “However, [it is] important to mention also as an exogenous factor the possibility of selling as the tax deadline is nearing in May ... always entertaining for sure.”Read More: Bitcoin Drops Below 100-Day MA as Selling Picks Up on Biden’s Tax PlansEther (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Friday, trading around $2,370 and falling 6.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). After making double-digit gains while bitcoin was in the dumps this week, ether has fallen with with the rest of crypto and was doing worse than bitcoin Friday in terms of 24-hour price performance. “ETH usually dumps more,"" said Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer of investment firm Ether Capital. “Whereas yesterday ETH was the outlier in terms of its strength, today is a more normal sight.”This year has seen more liquidity than ever flow into the ether market, and it seems to have occurred around the start of the year, according to data from CoinDesk Research. In 2020, average daily ether volume across exchanges was $12 billion. For 2021 so far, that figure has jumped to $36 billion in ETH volume per day. More liquidity means more traders buying and selling ether, meaning its price could easily rebound in bullish conditions, compared with previous years. That bullishness could come back. Ether Capital’s Coolican termed Friday’s bearish-leaning market as temporary after a crazy run-up so far this year.  “Generally, the crypto markets have been really robust for the past few months and it's not unusual to see some weakness after big runs,” he said.  Ether prices are still more than triple where they started the year. Read More: Chiliz’s CHZ Holders Love the Nasty Elbows – And the 20-Fold Price Gains in 2021Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all in the red Friday.

3789,"The head of South Korea’s financial regulatory agency has created controversy by saying all the country’s cryptocurrency exchanges could be shut down in September. During a meeting of the National Assembly’s policy committee on April 22, Eun Sung-soo, chair of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), said the agency has yet to receive any any Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) applications required under a recently amended law going into effect later this year. “There are an estimated 200 cryptocurrency exchanges in the country,” he added. “But if the current situation continues then all of them could be shut down.”  Eun was referring to South Korea’s anti-money laundering (AML) law, the Financial Transactions Reporting Act (FTRA), which was amended last year to apply to crypto exchanges. The legislation requires VASPs to register with financial authorities. The FSC began accepting applications for registration on March 25, but no exchanges have applied yet. Exchanges have until Sept. 24 to have their registration approved by the FSC. The FSC will only approve exchanges that can sufficiently demonstrate the robustness of their AML systems. On April 19, the government’s policy office issued a statement that authorities will implement a “special enforcement period” from April to September to shut down any “illegitimate crypto businesses” and ensure that exchanges are abiding by the FTRA.    The most important qualification for VASP registration is an official partnership with a local commercial bank. Out of the some 200 exchanges to which Eun alluded, only the country’s four largest exchanges, known as the “Big 4,” have established such partnerships thus far. Many industry insiders already think the Big 4 will end up being the only exchanges to survive the regulatory tidal wave, but Eun’s comments have stirred up new worries. Eun’s remarks come at a time when interest in crypto among Koreans is booming. The Big 4 registered 2.49 million new users during the first quarter of 2021, 64% of them in their 20s and 30s. Traders in their 30s devoted over $398 million on crypto trading, outspending every other demographic. Shutting down the Big 4 would deal a severe blow to these young investors.    When asked about normalizing crypto trading, Eun’s response was, “The worry is that officializing the cryptocurrency industry and bringing it in under regulatory approval will only encourage speculation.” Regarding legal protections for crypto traders against scams, Eun said that “it’s difficult for the state to protect crypto traders,” claiming that crypto trading is inherently more speculative than stock trading. He compared crypto transactions to fine art deals, explaining the state doesn’t take responsibility for consumers being scammed by art counterfeiters. “It’s the personal responsibility of the buyer to protect himself from [crypto] scams,” he said.   This isn’t the first time South Korea's traders have faced government-induced agita. In January 2018, the country’s justice minister announced during a press conference his ministry was “preparing legislation that effectively prohibits cryptocurrency trading” and that the ministry’s goal was to “shut down all exchanges.” Park went on to equate crypto trading with “gambling.”The global price of bitcoin plummeted 8% on the day of Park’s comments. Due to the so-called kimchi premium, the local price plunged as much as 15%. South Koreans refer to this day as the “Park Sang-ki disaster.”  On the day of Eun’s comments, the kimchi premium stood at around 13% but fell to as low as 2% the next day. This drop was coupled with a steep decline in bitcoin’s global price.",2021-04-23
3790,"Friday night’s mixed martial arts bout between British featherweight fighter Brendan Loughnane and Brazil’s Sheymon Moraes could make history – and not because of the expert footwork or the nasty elbows. It’s because the entire MMA fight was made possible through the wizardry of fast-emerging blockchain technology and one particular platform in particular: Socios, a unit of the company Chiliz, where sports fans can use the increasingly popular genre of cryptocurrencies known as “fan tokens” to express their devotion. Some lucky crypto traders have made a fortune betting on Chiliz’s in-house token, CHZ, which has surged 20-fold this year in digital-asset markets, to a previously unthinkable $2.3 billion market capitalization. That compares with a 70% year-to-date gain for bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, and a tripling in the price of No. 2 ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. In the case of Friday night’s Professional Fighters League (PFL) fight, the matchup was chosen by fans who purchased PFL-related tokens via Socios; they voted on whom they wanted to see square off in the EPSN+ event. The PFL fan tokens sold out in under 10 minutes for $500,000 during the initial launch.“This is what really got me excited,” Katie Talati, head of research for the cryptocurrency-focused asset-management firm Arca Funds, told CoinDesk in an interview, adding: When it comes to cryptocurrencies, of course, there’s no way to avoid the notorious price volatility. On Friday, the CHZ tokens appeared to get swept up in a broad sell-off across cryptocurrency markets. As of press time, the Chiliz coin price was down 21% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Whether the tokens are a good investment might come down to just how fast the platform grows. Malta-based Chiliz burned about $800,000 worth of Chiliz tokens Thursday after an impressive first-quarter earnings report, thanks to its business model of combining sports and crypto, two communities with some of the most committed adherents anywhere. The token burn means there’s now less supply in circulation, and so theoretically the remaining tokens should be worth more. The Chiliz token’s price increase year-to-date makes it one of the top performers among all cryptocurrencies with at least $1 billion market capitalization, according to Messari data, in a league with the astonishing performance of the meme token dogecoin (DOGE) and the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap’s CAKE token.Sports and crypto have already proved to be a powerful combination, with NBA Top Shot and its FLOW tokens recently becoming one of the hottest platforms for recently buzzy non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, in the form of digital trading cards linked to fans’ favorite NBA players’ video highlights.There are two major platforms under the company Chiliz: the Chiliz exchange, which facilitates trading fan tokens, and the Socios.com sports fan engagement platform, where sports fans can interact with their favorite sports team through fan tokens – both run on the Proof-of-Authority Chiliz blockchain.“Since last year, the digital-assets market has really started to recognize different sectors and different themes, and have used those kinds of themes for investments,”  Talati said. “Chiliz is just a very standalone project. There’s nothing else that’s in the sports realm that’s trying to use tokenization to incentivize fans in that same way.”Chiliz raised $65 million in 2018 through a private token sale to investors including Binance, OK Blockchain Capital and FBG Capital. Earlier this year, it received an equity investment from Chicago-based trading firm Jump Trading. The company also recently launched a partnership with the European affiliate of Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten, allowing Rakuten’s users in Europe to redeem their Rakuten points for fan tokens.Some 25 fan tokens are now offered on Socios after the company secured a series of partnerships with sport teams and leagues including FC Barcelona, Manchester City, Juventus and the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).“Large organizations like football clubs and the UFC need control of their brands and monetization rights,” Mason Nystrom, an analyst at Messari, wrote in a research analysis last September on Chiliz. “Tokenized loyalty points and rewards present new opportunities for increasing revenue beyond ticket sales. The push to grow digital lines of revenue will surely grow even once the pandemic subsides.”At the time of writing, the most-traded fan tokens on Chiliz exchange are FC Barcelona Fan Token and Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token, according to CoinMarketCap.As CoinDesk reported, the initial fan token sale of FC Barcelona ($BAR) last June hit well above $1.3 million with more than 600,000 tokens sold.The Chiliz project’s governance, according to Talati, also has made the token appealing for sports fans to hold  long-term.""As a woman, I love Beyonce, you know,"" Talati said. ""I can totally see Beyonce token one day"" given the high fan engagement empowered by the underlying blockchain technology of Chiliz. (In other words, catering to music listeners instead of sports nuts.)  Excluding the activity on the Chiliz exchange, trading volume in the CHZ token is most active on global crypto exchange giant Binance, Korea-based Upbit and OKEx, according to CoinGecko data, reflecting significant interest from retail speculators in East Asia.Based on growing interest in cryptocurrency as a whole, as well as the long-standing passion toward professional soccer leagues, Chiliz’s success in the East Asian countries was inevitable, Jason Kim, chief investment officer of the Tokyo-headquartered investment firm Anchor Value, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin has become too expensive for newly entered crypto investors in South Korea, and the relatively cheap and available Chiliz, especially with its sports theme, makes it a popular crypto investment there, Kim said.Of course, CHZ tokens are not nearly as cheap as they were a few months ago.",2021-04-23
3791,"In an ugly week for markets, it’s striking the crypto news that caught even more attention in the mainstream media was not bitcoin’s whopping 24% drop from its peak early Saturday morning, but dogecoin’s spectacular rally earlier in the week. This week’s column dives into why that phenomenon, while literally built on a joke concept, is not something to be laughed at. The surprising clout of the DOGE mob speaks volumes about how power is being redrawn in the digital age. And for this week’s podcast episode, we deliberately turn a blind eye to the number-go-up (and down) obsessions of the crypto market and talk about what really matters: human dignity. Sheila Warren and I talk to Human Rights Foundation Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein and a Sudanese activist who uses the pseudonym Mo and the handle @SudanHODL for his podcast to talk about what bitcoin, as a “global neutral money,” can do for human rights. Have a listen after reading the newsletter. A part of me worried I was giving in to temptation by writing this column. There’s an understandable concern within the CoinDesk newsroom that covering dogecoin could signal that we favor easy clicks from fanatics over the risk of encouraging bubble-fueled investments in a coin with no inherent technical advantages. But then I read Max Read’s excellent piece on the future of money from last week, which inspired a delightful New York Magazine cover that asked the question, “Can I SPAC my Stonks With NFTs?” I now realize – hear me out – there’s no more important story about the reimagination of money right now than $DOGE’s crazy price surge. (See the chart in the next section.) Dogecoin mania, as exemplified by the cryptocurrency community’s failed quest this week to get its price above 69 cents on Tuesday in honor of a 04/20/69 date meme associated with “national stoner day,” doesn’t just seem frivolous, it is. Yet, there’s real, serious money at stake. In that sense, dogecoin’s wild ride encapsulates an important moment in human history. Society’s traditional “story” of money is breaking down, where new, head-scratching concepts like SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are flourishing, and where fun and games and mob-buying can overwhelm markets.Doge is part of an intense competition for meaning within the world of money, a testament to the 21st century power shifts fueled by two separate financial crises and by the rise of social media networks. Let’s explore them.We start with the idea that money is a story.Regular readers will know I’m a fan of Yuval Harari, whose bestselling “Sapiens” argued that human civilization is built on our capacity to organize around commonly believed imagined concepts. Harari’s examples of these constructed ideas included “the corporation” and “the nation-state,” among others that have enabled us to form complex societies. It’s money, though, he says, that’s “the most successful story ever told.”Currencies do not have a core, intrinsic value. (Sorry, gold bugs, that applies to your favorite shiny metal as much to paper money and cryptocurrencies.) A currency’s value is dependent on shared belief in that value. That’s not to say certain types of money don't have qualities that help its story resonate, which is why bitcoin can be described as “sound money” and dogecoin cannot. But without belief, all money is worthless.For much of the past two millennia, the dominant story was that money’s value flowed from the sovereign because the state, empowered with taxation, had an overarching interest in optimizing the societal accounting function that is money’s true purpose. Then, more recently, in the era of fiat money it was the “good faith and credit” of the government (rather than a fixed supply of gold) that would guarantee that value. Later, that story was enhanced by the idea politically independent central banks would maintain a currency’s value by managing its supply in society’s best interest. Now, as we enter into a phase where state-backed money competes with both decentralized cryptographic money such as bitcoin or dogecoin and with corporate money such as diem (formerly libra) or Starbucks points, that narrowly defined story is falling apart. The first catalyst came a little more than a decade ago.In his piece, Read traces the current breakdown to an interview then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave to ""60 Minutes” in 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. Asked if the Fed’s monetary injections into troubled banks were funded by taxpayers, Bernanke shook his head and said: “To lend to a bank, we simply use the computer to mark up the size of the account that they have with the Fed.” He was telling it as it had long been: The Fed creates money by adding to or reducing banks’ reserves. But to the confused masses grappling with financial meltdown it was a revelatory challenge to the foundational story. It revealed that the creation of money is not bound by some sacred rule of scarcity and is mostly unrelated to the coins and banknotes that stand, in our collective imagination, as its representative units of value. It showed money as a digital accounting system a single entity can adjust through a few clicks on a computer. Fast forward to March 2020 and a new crisis: COVID-19. Amid a tanking global economy and a desperate scramble for dollars, the Fed took its “quantitative easing” policy into overdrive, declaring it will put as many fresh computer-based dollars as needed onto banks’ balance sheets to stave off financial collapse, with no upper limit on the program. It also expanded the category of assets it accepts in return for those new dollars to include corporate debt, exchange traded funds and other non-government instruments. It now seems the Fed will buy almost anything to prop up markets.Meanwhile, the “trillions” numbers attached to stimulus efforts in this new era of “QE infinity” are so unfathomably big that, as Bloomberg columnist Jared Dillian noted last spring, “money is losing its meaning.This erosion of meaning is leading people to question money’s value, which is naturally leading them to buy other things. It is reflected in the surging prices for assets that seem to outsiders to be unhinged from real-world value: in bitcoin, in Gamestop stock, in NFTs and, yes, in dogecoin. But before we get to Doge, consider another contributing factor: social media.Social media has challenged the central organizing structure of pre-internet society. Although the internet has failed to address wealth inequality in aggregate, the power for anyone to publish, and to do so pseudonymously, has had a democratizing effect, empowering communities to generate new stories around which to organize.This is meme culture. Social media enables the crowdsourcing of stories around memes, which in turn generates new forms of belief, a sense of purpose and camaraderie. And with that, these communities can, for once, stand up to the established order.That’s what we saw in the GameStop phenomenon, where a 7 million-strong Reddit community drove up the price of its favorite game retailer’s stock to impose huge losses on hedge funds that had tried to short-sell it on the view that its value was out of touch with reality. The dogecoin phenomenon is similar, with a key difference: There is no focal point for a regulator or a powerful Wall Street money manager to exert pressure against. This is a big departure from the GameStop case, where regulators and private equity funds essentially combined forces to stop Robinhood, the WallStreetBets group’s favored trading app, from processing trades in the stock, causing its price to collapse. With dogecoin, not only is there no one in charge of the cryptocurrency, trading activity is spread across dozens of exchanges, some of which are themselves decentralized. Who or what would a regulator go after? Dogecoin was created – as a joke, literally – by someone who not only quit the project but the entire crypto movement. Like Bitcoin, there was no premine or initial coin offering creating pre-launch tokens for founders and there is still no identifiable team of leaders able to manipulate dogecoin’s performance to its benefit and at the expense of others. For now at least, this structure leaves the far-flung, fanatical Doge community to go about its collective business of meme and buzz creation, stirring speculation in the coin.Equally important, it’s creating unique opportunities for others to hitch their wagon to this quirky, community-powered brand and its prevailing Shina Ibu logo: an image of fun, of absurdist irony and of common interest – a brand fit for the Gen-Z and millennial-led internet age. This is, in turn, giving rise to a new, symbiotic model for marketing as brands look to leverage the Doge community’s high-value engagement.A defining moment came with Slim Jim’s imaginative Doge-driven social media marketing campaign. But the foundation was laid in the early days of the dogecoin community, recounted recently by CoinDesk’s Ollie Leach, when enthusiasts spontaneously contributed to various marketing campaigns to boost the coin’s prominence. In 2014, there was a dogecoin-sponsored Nascar driver and, in a stroke of genius, the dogecoin-funded Jamaican bobsleigh team. Dogecoin will never be what bitcoin is or aspires to be: a store of value, a global reserve currency and a future medium of exchange for a decentralized economy. But in this unique convergence of memes, a fun brand, a strong community formation and some powerful marketing clout, we see how the 21st century digital media economy is reconceptualizing money. This does not mean you should invest in dogecoin. It does mean the Doge phenomenon matters.Today’s chart tracks dogecoin’s wild price ride against the performance of some well-established corporate names on Wall Street.Just two weeks ago, dogecoin’s market cap was $8.3 billion, just below that of Hyatt Hotels. Then it started rising, not only beating out the hotel chain but also surpassing, in quick succession, the valuations of engineering giant Halliburton, banking conglomerate Credit Suisse and insurer Aflac. Then, last weekend, the $DOGE market cap rose above $45 billion to get beyond that of 330-year-old British bank Barclays, before peaking on Monday at $53.98 billion, a hair above Swiss banking giant UBS. Since then, dogecoin’s valuation has slipped back and was just below $40 billion on Thursday afternoon. That’s on par with asset management giant T. Rowe Price. Not bad for a joke coin.Stansberry Research staged a much-anticipated debate this week between MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who is a prominent bitcoin advocate, and investor Frank Giustra, a fan of gold and a bitcoin skeptic. It got a lot of attention. Saylor, who crowdsourced his debate prep with the help of a sci-fi themed battle scene, opened with some big statements. He suggested that if a deity were to come down and design the perfect “God coin” system, Bitcoin would come closest to having the same attributes. (For the record, he also provided a detailed description of how Bitcoin works and why he believes it is the highest form of “sound money.”)The imagery and hyperbole seemed to irk Giustra, who said the use of laser eyes and other crypto-insider jokes made Bitcoin “feel like a cult.” In a follow-up tweet, gold market media outlet Gold Telegraph chose to emphasize that point by superimposing alongside a video of Giustra an image of a laser-eyed Saylor as the Pied Piper, leading a crowd to its demise.Who won? Predictably, opinions divided along tribal lines, though bitcoiners seemed more confident of Saylor’s victory than gold bugs were of Giustra’s. Here’s podcaster and prominent bitcoin supporter Preston Pysh, whose Twitter feed was full of snippets of the MicoStrategy CEO making “devastating” points against his opponent.In contrast, outspoken gold investor and bitcoin critic James Rickards declared that “Frank won on substance” in what was the “best ever” gold vs. bitcoin debate.The weeklong bitcoin price rout began last weekend in rather dubious fashion.",2021-04-23
3792,"Crypto lender Celsius warned clients in a tweet on Friday they should add crypto to their accounts in the event the lender has to demand additional collateral from borrowers.In the bitcoin crash of March 2020, several crypto lenders, including Celsius, had to make margin calls in the hundreds of millions of dollars. In Friday’s tweet, the lender said clients should be prepared for margin calls because of “market conditions.”Crypto lending is popular among holders who want to raise cash without selling their coins and market makers who want to fill orders quickly. The phenomenon could potentially improve liquidity and price discovery for crypto assets but it also has introduced systemic risks.On Sunday, Nexo, another crypto lender, sent out an email to clients titled ""Safeguarding Your Assets Throughout the Current Market Volatility,"" in which the lender encourages its customers to set up ""adequate notifications for price fluctuations and potential margin calls to avoid liquidation of your assets.""""Yes, we issued a few margin calls but nothing dramatic at this stage,"" said Nexo co-founder and managing partner Antoni Trenchev.Meanwhile, crypto lender Unchained Capital adjusted its loan-to-value maximum down to 40% in February in response to crypto price increases at the beginning of the year. The new LTV is meant to ""help protect clients from margin call scenarios,"" said Unchained Capital CEO Joseph Kelly.Over at crypto lender BlockFi, CEO Zac Prince noted that BTC, ETH, and LTC loans at his firm max out at LTVs of 50%. ""I think others may finance coins further down the market cap stack at higher initial LTVs, which may be creating a higher risk environment for their clients now,"" Prince said.Matthew Ballensweig, lending director at Genesis, a crypto lender that's owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, said that all of Genesis' clients have fulfilled their margin calls or have paired back loan balances.""On the most recent selloff, we’re seeing some trading firms take some profits on the short basis trade and return USD loans until the spread widens out again,"" Ballensweig said. ""Others continue to hold USD loan balances and post additional BTC collateral to maintain their position.""These warnings come as crypto coins are almost universally in the red, a drop many attribute to U.S. President Joe Biden’s proposed increase in the capital gains tax.Update (April 23, 17:53 UTC): Added comments from Nexo, Unchained Capital, BlockFi, and Genesis executives.

3793,"Investment firm Bitwise Asset Management is filing to register its flagship crypto fund as a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting company.If the U.S. regulator deems the Form 10 filing effective, shares of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund would be registered under the Exchange Act of 1934, meaning it would have to regularly file public updates on its holdings and quarterly reports with the SEC. That could help woo investors who prefer the clockwork disclosures of public companies like Apple over the tight-lipped mystery of many crypto products. Investors who do buy in can also sell their shares within six months, rather than the 12 months accredited investors must hold shares. Shares in Bitwise 10 already trade on the over-the-counter market under the ticker BITW. But reporting company status would improve transparency and liquidity for shareholders.Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund would become the first non-Grayscale-owned crypto product with that distinction  and the first reporting company to offer investors broad exposure to coins.

3796,"Bitcoin (BTC) has slumped more than 8%, over a 24-hour period, a drop attributed to U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed tax increase on capital gains on those earning above $1 million. But the effect may be temporary, according to the CEO of a leading crypto-dedicated payment services provider.Biden’s proposed treatment of capital gains as income, which stipulates a rate of up to 39.6% instead of the current 23.8%, has had ""a shock effect in all markets,"" BCB Group CEO Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie told CoinDesk.  Still, cryptocurrency is likely to be unaffected over the long-term, he said.""While the shock may be sustained in stock markets, the nature of cryptocurrency will see straight through this dip,"" Landsberg-Sadie said.He said MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor and Tesla's Elon Musk have both made their views ""abundantly clear"" about holding bitcoin in their corporate treasuries.""The difference between cryptocurrency and any other market is that we’re seeing more and more large-scale crypto buyers who simply have no intent on exiting the position,"" Landsberg-Sadie said. Instead, the stock-to-flow model cited by blockchain hedge fund Pantera Capital for its prediction that the price of bitcoin will reach $115,000 this summer will be a ""much stronger driver of value than fiat-based tax.""According to Landsberg-Sadie, the drop in bitcoin's value on Friday has been an ""overreaction"" to Biden's capital gains proposal and will likely bounce back to the Pantera projections where its next high is somewhere above $70,000.See also: Bitcoin Dominance Sinks Below 50% for First Time Since 2018Bitcoin is currently changing hands at about $49,400.",2021-04-23

3798,"Bitcoin slipped on Friday as reports of U.S. President Joe Biden mulling a tax hike on wealthy Americans drew stronger selling pressure in the spot market. The biggest cryptocurrency traded well below the 100-day simple moving average support of $49,470 during the European hours, marking the first breakdown of the widely tracked technical line in six months and extending the recent sell-off from record highs above $64,000.Other alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether, binance token, XRP, dogecoin, suffered bigger pullbacks, having outperformed bitcoin in recent days. Dogecoin slipped nearly 25%, while others witnessed 14% to 18% drawdowns against bitcoin's 11% drop. ""The market has been trading extremely risk on due to Federal Reserve's [liquidity-boosting] policy that supported risk trades. Now the reality of the Biden administration hits, and the market is going to start worrying about taxes & regulations,"" Phillip Gillespie, CEO of the over-the-counter liquidity provider B2C2 Japan, told CoinDesk.As per The New York Times, President Biden is planning to roughly double the tax on capital gains or proceeds earned from selling assets to 39.6% from 20%. The new rate will be applicable for people earning more than $1 million a year.The news hit the wires late Thursday and tanked the U.S. equity markets, aggravating the weakness in bitcoin.""The cryptocurrency was already on the defensive, having breached the long-held 50-day SMA support earlier this week,"" Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange. ""The tax news invited more profit-taking.""Bitcoin dropped sharply from $60,000 to $52,148 early Sunday, taking the cryptocurrency below the 50-day SMA for the first time since October. While that move was largely derivatives-driven, the latest drop below $50,000 is likely a result of selling in the spot market.""I think ultimately at the core, it's a spot-driven sell-off, with the market having been quite vulnerable to pullback after a parabolic price surge in Q1 2021,"" Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said.The U.S.-based Coinbase exchange has seen big offers (blue) in the past 24 hours. Bitfinex sellers (green) appear to have played a role as well, according to data provided by Coin Metrics.Further, exchanges witnessed a net inflow of 20,370 BTC on Wednesday, the highest since March 20, according to data source Glassnode. Investors typically move coins to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings.Bitcoin might regain some poise over the next few days, having seen a 25% drop since Coinbase's debut on Nasdaq on April 14. However, a solid v-shaped recovery may remain elusive, as per trader and analyst Alex Kruger.""Crashes characterized by heavy spot selling don't bounce as hard, making BTFD (buy the f***ing dip) much more challenging,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted early today.According to Delta Exchange's Pankaj Balani, the market is likely to remain choppy till the end of June, and rallies could be short-lived. ""It's a sell on the rise market for now,"" Balani said, a convincing move above $60,000 would revive the bullish bias.Renewed whale buying may be needed to revive the animal spirits in the bitcoin market. Bitcoin's bullish momentum has steadily weakened over the past two months alongside the near 10% drop in the whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 bitcoinFor now, short-term technical studies appear to have rolled over in favor of the bears, and the negative bias would strengthen if prices find acceptance under the 100-day SMA. ""A deeper pullback is certainly possible. One needs to look no further than a still well extended monthly chart that warns of the risk for additional weakness and consolidation before that next major leg higher,"" LMAX Digital's Joel Kruger said, adding that their focus is on a longer-term upside. According to Curtis Ting, Kraken's managing director of Europe, the latest 25% pullback is typical of a bull market correction and the broader bias remains constructive. Indeed, bitcoin saw several 20%-30% drawdowns during the 2017 bull run.""We won't attempt to make short-term predictions on the price, but bitcoin's core fundamentals and value proposition remain unchanged."" Ting said.Bitcoin is changing hands near $48,000 at press time, and the SMA is located at $49,470, according to CoinDesk 20 data.
