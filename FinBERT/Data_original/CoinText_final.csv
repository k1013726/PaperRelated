16401,"Global e-commerce giant Overstock.com has hired the developers behind peer-to-peer decentralized exchange Counterparty to develop a new stock market platform powered by cryptocurrency technology.The developers will work on a platform called 'Medici', an evolution of Overstock's previously announced 'cryptosecurity' offering that will allow not only Overstock, but other businesses, the ability to issue cryptosecurities to the investing public.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne made the official announcement at the Inside Bitcoins Las Vegas conference today during his keynote speech entitled 'Cryptosecurities: the Next Digital Frontier’. The three-day conference began on 5th October and will run through 7th October at the Flamingo Hotel & Casino.Speaking to CoinDesk, Byrne indicated that this latest move finds Overstock advancing beyond the exploratory phase with crypto 2.0 technologies.Byrne told CoinDesk:With the announcement, Counterparty founders Robby Dermody and Evan Wager told CoinDesk that they have now turned their focus primarily to the Medici project, though this will entail work for Counterparty as Medici will be built on top of the Counterparty protocol. Dermody and Wagner are now working to find replacement candidates to cover their duties at Counterparty while working on Medici.The developers will first work to create the software as part of the Overstock corporate entity, but they will eventually be allocated to a new company that will seek to monetize the platform and introduce new value-added services.Launched in January, Counterparty quickly built itself into a market leader using a DIY approach, the bitcoin protocol and Counterparty's own native currency XCP to facilitate digital asset exchange. Counterparty developer Adam Krellenstein will continue to work full-time on Counterparty following the announcement.In addition to the Counterparty development team, Byrne told CoinDesk that the project will also involve Perkins Coie, the Seattle-based law firm that represents some 40 startups in the bitcoin space, including major players such as bitcoin wallet provider Xapo and digital currency exchanges Kraken and Coinsetter.Byrne indicated that Perkins Coie will help the Medici project with what will perhaps be its toughest challenge, securing approval with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US federal regulator that enforces securities law and regulates that nation's stock and options exchanges.Byrne told CoinDesk:Overstock first announced its intention to explore a cryptosecurity offering via a company wiki page in late July.At the time, Byrne told CoinDesk that the move was, in part, an attempt to raise the issue of cryptosecurities with the SEC.For the initial proposal, Overstock asked the bitcoin community to provide the company with information on asset trading platforms that might be able to host the offering, with BitShares, Counterparty, Ethereum and NXT all receiving attention among a wider field of competitors.Byrne said that while he had considered other platforms, he ultimately felt that the Counterparty team and its underlying use of the bitcoin protocol provided the best opportunity to bring his ideas to light.""The block chain has been pounded on by all these hackers around the world,"" he said. ""It's the most secure.""Byrne went on to laud Krellenstein, Dermody and Wager for their dedication to philosophy, math and computer science, as well as their decidedly non-Wall Street approach to finance.""They're true to the ethics of bitcoin, true to the open-source nature, they're true to the principles,"" Byrne added.At press time, the value of XCP, Counterparty's native currency has increased more than 150% on the news.Dermody told CoinDesk that his team saw the Medici project as too big to ignore, given the effects its success could have on businesses and the wider economy.Likewise, Wagner said Medici will go beyond previous asset exchange projects through its effort to ensure the technology meets the approval of US regulators.""Medici will provide a comprehensive built-in digital asset exchange, [but] that's very different when you're going through a process of regulatory compliance,"" he said. ""This project is going to make that effort.""Byrne said the name Medici was also chosen as a reflection of the project's ambitious goals, as it takes the name of the famous 15th century Italian bank that made notable contributions to the fields of accounting and banking.""It seemed like an appropriate tip of the hat,"" Byrne said.Hat tip to WIREDImages via CoinDesk; Anthony Correia / Shutterstock.com",2014-10-07
16402,"Russian authorities confiscated four bitcoin mining machines from an unidentified citizen last week at a security checkpoint located on its southern border with China.A report from the Siberian Customs Department suggests that the individual attempted to bring ""four undeclared metal objects"", later identified as ROCKMINER R4 units, through a customs checkpoint at the Manzhouli Sino-Russian Inter-Trade Tourist Area.However, the bitcoin miner failed to provide the necessary documentation or pay required fees for doing so.The customs officers evoked a 2012 decision issued by the Board of Eurasian Economic Commission to validate the confiscation. The decision, amended in 2013 and 2014, governs the import and export of encryption facilities to and from Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, all of which are members of one customs agreement.Despite the increasingly stern stance Russia has taken toward its domestic bitcoin industry in recent weeks, the incident appears to be unrelated to the country's proposed ban of ""monetary surrogates"". Further, it does not suggest a more immediate crackdown on bitcoin's domestic mining industry and community.The draft bill, first announced in August, garnered even more headlines internationally last week as Russian lawmakers revealed the full text of the proposed law. If passed, the law would apply to virtually all of the country's industry, from individual bitcoin miners to bitcoin businesses and even news sites.In addition to the loss of the mining units, the unidentified miner also faces potential fines, as the Siberian Customs Department indicated it has initiated administrative proceedings in the developing case.Due to initial confusion surrounding the news, there was speculation on Russian bitcoin blogs that the incident was perhaps part of a more immediate crackdown by the local government on bitcoin activities.Russian-language bitcoin news blog Coinside.ru, for example, wrote in its report that the news could be seen as ""the start of the practical part of the Russian campaign against bitcoin"".However, Artem Tolkachev, managing partner at the law firm Tolkachev & Partners disagreed with this interpretation, noting that the initial news release suggests mining equipment is simply subject to the same special customs regulations as all types of encrypted materials.""The document makes no special reference to the mining equipment, but it divides the encryption facilities into different groups and establishes the order of import and export,"" Tolkachev told CoinDesk.In absence of the formal approval of the draft bill banning bitcoin activities, Tolkachev asserted that, in his opinion, the import and export of bitcoin mining equipment is still legal in Russia provided the owner seeks a one-time license from the Ministry of Industry and Trade.Still, the procedures required could prove to be a deterrent to local mining operators, especially in light of potential forthcoming regulation.Tolkachev said:Further, he said this procedure must be completed in 90 days, but that in some cases, only approval from the FSB is needed.Tolkachev provides legal consultation to a number of regional startups, though he says most are now turning focus away from the Russian market in light of recent events.Image credit: Pavel L Photo and Video / Shutterstock.com",2014-10-06
16403,"SnapCard has announced a $1.5m seed round led by noted bitcoin investor Tim Draper.Launched in November 2013, snapCard has long offered a browser plugin that enabled consumers to purchase items from major e-commerce platforms that don't currently accept bitcoin. However, the investment marks its emergence from four-to-five months of relative quiet and under-the-radar development.The funding round coincides with snapCard's launch of its own digital currency payment processor that will allow merchants the ability to accept bitcoin, popular altcoins such as litecoin and dogecoin, and XRP, the native digital currency that powers the distributed payment protocol offered by Ripple Labs.Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Michael Dunworth voiced his belief that snapCard can compete in an established field of merchant processors by focusing on developing markets, particularly Latin America.Dunworth told CoinDesk:Brock Pierce-led investment group Crypto Currency Partners, Fortress Investment Group-backed Insikt Ventures, Great Oaks Venture Capital, noted bitcoin-friendly startup incubator Boost VC, as well as a number of undisclosed angel investors, also contributed to the investment round.In conjunction with the launch, snapCard also unveiled a point-of-sale (POS) app for its brick-and-mortar merchant clients, available for Android devices from the Google Play Store.While Dunworth framed snapCard as an aspiring global service, initially the company will open to merchant customers in bitcoin's most developed markets, Australia, Canada and the US.Still, Dunworth said this will change soon, should the company be able to execute its market strategy:Boost VC's Adam Draper told CoinDesk that this big-picture vision was one of the core reasons he has invested in the platform, which also earlier graduated from Boost VC's startup incubator.Calling snapCard a ""force to be reckoned with in the payments space"", Draper added:SnapCard will accept bitcoin on behalf of consumers and provide local fiat via direct deposit, or send the digital currency directly to a third-party wallet of the merchant's choice. Like competitors BitPay and GoCoin, the company does not offer its own digital wallet.To ease merchant concerns regarding security, snapCard indicates it will leverage a bug bounty program offered by CrowdCurity, the IT security startup that raised $1m in seed funding this July from a group of investors including Tim Draper.SnapCard will further conduct identity verification through BlockScore, a California-based startup that garnered $2m in seed funding from Battery Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Boost VC.To begin with, merchants must provide an email address, as well as details of the type of service they provide, how they plan to use snapCard, and whether it will be used at all or some of the businesses locations or at only events and promotions.Merchants are then verified by snapCard after providing their full legal name, home address, phone number, date of birth and the last four digits of their social security number.The funding news provides the latest evidence that, despite the number of established providers in the bitcoin merchant processing space, major VCs believe there's room for more alternatives.SnapCard will now need to compete for new clients against BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin, all three of which recently gained the ability to onboard merchants through PayPal's Payments Hub platform.Dunworth acknowledged the challenge of competing against these companies in more developed markets, but suggested that snapCard's international focus will be its key advantage.""We're trying to act really quickly,"" he said, ""lining up essential partnerships that can allow for strong distribution to get a footprint going.""Ultimately, he even took an optimistic view on this aspect of the space, suggesting it will help all of the ecosystem's processors continue to innovate.""I think the competition is healthy because it gives consumers a choice,"" he concluded.Merchant image via Shutterstock",2014-10-06
16404,"In this concluding article of our series looking at Silk Road, a year after its closure, we examine the impact the Silk Road bust had on the dark markets and their most widely used digital currency, bitcoin. The FBI may have taken down the Silk Road in spectacular fashion, slapping a seizure notice on the dark marketplace's website and executing the high-profile public arrests of Ross Ulbricht, and later, bitcoin executive Charlie Shrem and digital currency trader Robert Faiella.According to academics and researchers studying dark web markets – which transact almost exclusively in bitcoin – listings for illicit goods and services have actually grown in the aftermath of the Silk Road bust. The rising popularity of such markets among drug vendors and customers means that illicit trade is set to expand even more, one researcher believes.Bitcoin's creation and subsequent explosive popularity has been a crucial factor in the growth of global dark markets, according to James Martin, a senior lecturer and researcher at the Macquarie University Centre for Policing, Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism, who has written a new book about the subject.Martin said:In the six months following Silk Road's shakedown by the FBI, new dark markets proliferated and listings for illicit goods surged, researchers at the Digital Citizens Alliance (DCA) have found.The non-profit group, which works on promoting Internet safety to ordinary web users, found that the number of drugs listings on the biggest dark markets had almost doubled by March to 32,029, compared to six months earlier when Silk Road was taken offline.The DCA report looked at listings on 11 currently live dark markets, of which six were newly launched platforms. It compared the latest listings to the 18,174 for drugs on the four major dark markets that existed last October.Among the current markets it examined are Silk Road 2.0, Agora and Evolution, plus new entrants White Rabbit Anonymous Marketplace, Outlaw Market and The Pirate Market. The dark markets operating last year also included now-defunct dark markets Silk Road, Black Market Reloaded, Sheep Marketplace and DeepBay.Given that the most widely used digital currency of dark markets is bitcoin, just how much of the cryptocurrency is sloshing around in these illicit bazaars?The proportion of the bitcoin economy undergirded by dark market trade is best estimated in a 2012 paper by Nicolas Christin, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who does work at its information security lab.Christin collected data from Silk Road over eight months between the end of 2011 and 2012. Over this period, he found that 1.35 million BTC were exchanged on the dark market. Comparing that to the 29.6 million BTC traded on other exchanges over the same period, he found that Silk Road transactions corresponded to 4.5% of all traded BTC.When Christin took other factors into account, like the possibility of Silk Road users buying bitcoin to fund their dark market purchases and then trading bitcoin back to fiat currency, the number of potential transactions attributed to Silk Road activity could double from a conservative estimate of 4.5% to as much as 9% of all bitcoin trading activity, as measured by traded value on exchanges at the time.But 2011 and 2012 were very different times for bitcoin. The bitcoin price hit a high of $9 during Christin's observation period; it's trading between $350 and $400 today.Christin also found that at the time, 24,000 items were being sold on Silk Road over a six-month period. Contrast that to the 13,000 in drug listings alone on Silk Road that the DCA recorded in just one October day, before the bust.That's why Christin is updating his study. He said he's collected a fresh set of data from dark markets that he's in the process of analysing. He won't say what markets he's looked at, and won't be drawn on any preliminary analysis of his new data. He said it will be several months before the research is ready for publication.Christin said he's not surprised by the growth of new dark markets in the wake of Silk Road's demise, alluding to the amount of publicity generated by the busts and the arrests of Ulbricht and Shrem, but he noteed that the growth in listings recorded by the DCA may not mean dark web trading activity has increased.""I want to emphasise that it is unclear that the number of listings is a good proxy for economic activity. One might list a large number of items and yet not carry out that many sales,"" he said.The growth of dark markets poses the question: If law enforcement agencies have already shown they can break the screen of anonymity afforded by the Tor network and bitcoin transactions, why are new dark markets popping up with more listings than ever before?Martin, of Macquarie's policing and intelligence research institute, thinks it's because drug dealers are finding it's far safer to do business this way – even with the threat of an FBI raid hanging over them.He said:For drug dealers, Martin says, dark markets present a new opportunity to strip away the ""systemic violence"" associated with the distribution and secure storage of narcotics. A dark market vendor doesn't have to deal with the organised crime groups that traditionally take care of drug distribution and security in return for protection money, he said.It's not just the vendors who are enjoying the benefits of illicit e-commerce. Drug buyers can now browse a vast catalogue of narcotics on their phablets, with comprehensive reviews from fellow customers to provide an indication of quality.Consumers are also safer because they don't have to interact with potentially violent gang enforcers, either. Instead, the postman drops off their latest dark market order at their doorstep.Martin cautions that the amount of trade taking place on dark markets is tiny compared to the global trade in illicit narcotics. Global Financial Integrity, a non-profit focused on tracking illicit financial flows, estimates that drug trafficking amounted to trade flows of $320bn in 2011. The dark web trade is a tiny slice of that, Martin says, although researchers haven't been able to quantify it. By comparison, the FBI alleges that Silk Road made annual revenues of $1.2bn.However, dark web drug sales are attractive to both vendors and customers, so they are set to grow, Martin said:While the terms 'deep web' and 'dark web' are often banded about interchangeably, they don't mean the same thing.The deep web refers to any portion of the web that isn't indexed by a search engine. Content that lives on the deep web includes relatively innocuous – and sometimes stultifying – material, like the database containing North Dakota's court records, which is maintained by the government of the rural US state.Google and other search engines don't crawl through the contents of these databases, so they're invisible to someone traversing the web on its most well-travelled highways.The deep web, then, is the part of the web that's hidden from the 'surface web', which is what search engines can find. That's the definition of the term according to Bright Planet, a consultancy focused on the deep web founded by the man credited with coining the term, Mike Bergman.So much for the deep web. What about the dark web? As you may have guessed, this is where things can get illicit. The dark web is that section of the web that is both intentionally hidden and cannot be accessed by a standard web browser, according to Bright Planet.Dark web sites usually have addresses that aren't governed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the international body that regulates domain names. Websites ending in .com or .org, for example, are governed by ICANN.Domains that exist beyond the ICANN system are known as alternative DNS roots or ADRs. These include websites that end in .geek, .micro or .bit, as is the case with Namecoin domain names.Websites on the Tor network, which include Silk Road and other marketplaces for illicit goods mentioned in this article, are examples of dark web sites. These sites end with the .onion suffix.Accessing websites with ADR domains usually requires a specific piece of software. For sites on the Tor network, the Tor Browser, a piece of software designed specifically for surfing that network, must be installed to access them.There are signs that dark markets are evolving beyond the drugs-infatuated niche of Silk Road and its genre.The creators of OpenBazaar, for example, want to bring their decentralised market to a wider swathe of Internet users who aren't interested in buying drugs, but do want to preserve their autonomy and privacy.OpenBazaar is a peer-to-peer marketplace that lets vendors hawk their wares anonymously and without relying on a central platform. Vendors host their product listings on their own computers. Trade is conducted in bitcoin.Sam Patterson, who leads operations for the open-source project, says OpenBazaar is nothing like Silk Road or its successors.By contrast, Patterson, said, the platform he's building is decentralised – no one owns the network – and it's simply a platform for individuals to conduct business without an intermediary skimming off commissions and fees.""It is a platform for people to manage their own trade online, directly with others,"" he said.Even as the dark web develops at a rapid clip – there is a now a trade publication reporting on market goings-on and a search engine to make dark market shopping easier – law enforcement agencies seem to be left trailing in the wake of decentralised, encrypted platforms.Martin, the drugs trade researcher, said he has spoken to law enforcement agencies and they are struggling to police dark markets, despite US agencies' spectacular takedown of Silk Road.""With online drug trading, you have hidden financial transactions; the dealer and customer never meet in the same place; you have drugs arriving in the post [...] all of this breaks the 'business model' of conventional law enforcement,"" he said.Anti-narcotics agencies need to come to grips with dark markets quickly because they are only set to grow, Martin added. Just as e-commerce was pooh-poohed by brick and mortar retailers 20 years before giving rise to retailing giants like Amazon and Alibaba today, law enforcement is now only dimly aware of the development of dark markets. Image via Shutterstock",2014-10-06
16405,"Portuguese manufacturer Bitcoin Já launched its first Bitcoin ATM in Lisbon over the weekendThe company is a brand new name in the world of bitcoin ATMs, so this is not only its first bitcoin machine in Portugal, but also the world.The launch of the 'BJATM1’ model took place at the ATM's permanent location, Lisbon's @Cinema theatre, on Saturday, 4th October.Bitcoin Jádescribes its ATM as a versatile, feature rich and highly scalable system. Being a two-way machine, it currently allows users to buy or sell bitcoins for fiat currency.However, the company said it is already working on software updates that will enable support for altcoins and PayPal payments, as well as certain types of service payments.CoinDesk discussed the launch with Bitcoin Já founder Joaquim Lambiza, who was keen to note that the machine had been extensively tested by his team and some members of Lisbon’s bitcoin community.Lambiza has previously worked as a partner at IBM and PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where he was responsible for several global IT projects.“I left IBM to dedicate myself to my two passions – aviation and finding the disruptive technology that will change our lives. I found that in the block chain technology,” Lambiza told CoinDesk.Lambiza said he decided to launch an ATM in Portugal last January, but was not satisfied with the approach or returns offered by existing solutions. His solution? To create his own from scratch.Lambiza explains:He added that Bitcoin Já plans to sell ATMs rather than operate them, with the exception of the Lisbon installation which doubles as the company’s showrooms. Therefore the company will not charge a fee to operators for basic functionality.The project was funded solely by Bitcoin Já.Lambiza said his system is very scalable, and thus allows variety of features to potential operators – whether they decide to operate just one machine or a cluster of them.Operators can also either choose a hot wallet or one of a number of supported exchange services. The Lisbon unit will use a hot wallet, with a 3% fee to be levied from customers.What sets the ATM apart from the rest of the competition, he indicated, is the guiding design concept employed by the team, emphasising community development and operator profitability. It allows for a lot of scalability, customisation and more revenue for potential operators.“In my opinion, keeping the operator profitable will help grow the network and indirectly promote and grow the crypto-currency industry,” Lamboza explained.The upcoming addition of PayPal and service payments, Lamboza argues, will increase both flexibility and revenue for the operator, rendering the units more attractive compared with other firms' productsShortly after the ATM went live, the Bank of Portugal appeared to address the launch directly, issuing a warning on the use of bitcoin and bitcoin ATMs, as reported in the Algarve Daily News. The statement pointed out that bitcoin ATMs are not integrated with the country's ATM system and that digital currencies are unsafe and unregulated.As with the many previous cautionary statements issued by European regulators, it names volatility, lack of regulation and consumer protection mechanisms, AML issues and potential criminal activities as the bank's main concerns.However, the warning says nothing about the legality of operating and using bitcoin ATMs, which remain legal in PortugalThe publication also reported that Algarve is expected to get its first bitcoin ATM soon.",2014-10-06
16406,"Binary Financial has officially launched BTC-01, a bitcoin liquidity service that aims to target high net-worth investors who it believes are being turned away from the bitcoin market due to a lack of high-touch alternatives.BTC-01 will open Binary Financial's established bitcoin trading services to the family offices, investment institutions and wealthy individuals who want to gain exposure to bitcoin and the broader asset class that is springing up around the technology.Speaking to CoinDesk, Binary Financial managing partner Harry Yeh said that BTC-01 is the product of months of research as well as the trial and error that comes from operating an existing trading service in a rapidly evolving market. The digital asset investment specialist conducts proprietary cryptocurrency trading, hosts its own bitcoin mining operations and recently made an investment in mining manufacturer BitFury.Yeh cited the trading flurry surrounding China's tightening of financial controls around its domestic bitcoin industry last December as the inspiration for its new trading product. He said that Binary Financial was beseiged by calls from big investors at the time, but that due to the limitations on the technology underpinning its operations, it was unable to fully capitalize on the market.He told CoinDesk:BTC-01 marks an evolution in Binary's service, as the platform will use the enterprise security solutions offered by multisig bitcoin wallet specialist BitGo to better serve its clientele, whether they want to have total control of their funds, or allow Binary to operate as the custodian.""BitGo is the only wallet that can support these types of use cases [...] and allow Binary to manage their trades in the way a wealth manager would manage their stock portfolio,"" CEO Will O'Brien told CoinDesk.BTC-01 will initially serve clients in North American and China, though Yeh said Binary is evaluating other markets.Many of Binary's clients seek to put 5%–10% of their wealth into bitcoin with the same convenience they would when investing in traditional asset classes.The solutions offered by BitGo, Yeh said, allow Binary to remove pain points for customers while allowing them better access to bitcoin markets.With BitGo's multisig service, Binary will create three keys for each account, extending one to the investor, while another is shared by Binary and the client. In turn, the third key is kept for disaster recovery. With the move, Binary joins BitFury and the Bitcoin Foundation as the latest digital currency company to enable BitGo's platform.O'Brien went on to cite the additional advantages his company's technology can provide in terms of convenience and security, saying:Binary further framed BTC-01 as a necessary market offering for the many North American and Chinese wealth management firms that are seeking to serve high net-worth clients.Yeh told CoinDesk that Binary's research over the last year revealed that 25%–50% of wealth managers and investment banks in North America have clients asking about bitcoin, and 25% of these clients are ready to buy.However, Yeh added, before BTC-01 wealth mangers and investment banks had been unable to capitalize on client interest due to the comparatively thin order books on major bitcoin exchanges, the relatively limited offerings at mass market bitcoin brokerages and regulatory uncertainty.Though these companies could sign up for accounts at major exchanges, Yeh asserts that what they're really looking for is a trusted partner that can navigate the complexities of what is, for their operations, a relatively niche offering.""A lot of the wealth managers we deal with, their biggest frustration point is they just want to service their clients. They just want somebody who can be trusted they can send somebody to,"" Yeh said.Even if wealth managers and investment banks seek to use services provided by exchanges, there are advantages to over-the-counter trading.Yeh, for example, has long talked about the slippage that occurs on major bitcoin exchanges, whereby those who execute large bitcoin buy orders actually cause the price of bitcoin to rise, thereby increasing the cost of their investment as demand rises and individual bitcoins in the buy order increase in price.Yeh notes that this market behavior can also occur on the selling side, and that one of the main value-adds for BTC-01 is the liquidity it will offer traders.""Part of what the service provides,"" Yeh explained, ""is we have people that are almost always ready to take the other side of a trade, all across the world.""Yeh also explained that Binary is launching BTC-01, in part, because the firm believes wealth managers are looking for this solution today, because bitcoin is trading at a low.""We do have a larger number of wealth managers looking to diversify their portfolios, but they've been waiting for the price to go down, so this is one of those better buying opportunities,"" Yeh said.Yeh went on to voice his belief that services like BTC-01, which help onboard new, high net-worth investors to the bitcoin market, will also have a positive effect on the wider bitcoin market, saying:He added: ""We think longer-term this is positive for the price of bitcoin.""Images via Binary Financial; Shutterstock",2014-10-06
16407,"The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation has released the full version of the draft bill that, if passed in current form, would effectively ban the creation and distribution of software that allows for the use of money substitutes, including bitcoin and all digital currencies.First announced as a proposal in August, the news marks the first time that the Ministry of Finance has made the proposed law public, as well as its definition of ""money surrogates"" under which bitcoin and digital currencies may be prohibited.The two-page draft bill details a series of administrative fines to be imposed on both businesses and private citizens who issue, create or deliberately disseminate information about the release or operation of digital currencies, the language implying that the law would apply to much of the bitcoin industry, from bitcoin users to miners and service providers.For example, individuals who are found to issue or create bitcoin or digital currencies will be penalized with fines of 30,000–50,000 rubles ($750–$1,250). Similarly, officials found to engage in such practices will be subject to fines of 60,000–100,000 rubles ($1,500–$2,500), while legal entities will be eligible for fines of 500,000–1m rubles ($12,500–$25,000).A similar series of fines is also detailed for those found to have disseminated information that ""permits the release of money substitutes"". Individuals engaging in this practice would be subject to fines 5,000–50,000 rubles ($125–$1,250); officials, 20,000–100,000 rubles ($500–$2,500); and legal entities 500,000–1m rubles ($12,500–$25,000).At press time, much of the domestic industry was still reacting to the news. Anton Vereshchagin, founder of InterMoneyExchange, which had planned to launch in Russia but has since moved to other markets, told CoinDesk:He added: ""In fact, the restrictions and prohibitions are only getting worse.""The draft bill also calls for the amendment of the definition of money surrogates in Russia to include language that would cover new financial technologies such as digital currencies.Under the revision, the definition would include any ""monetary unit"" issued as a means of payment or exchange and not allowed under federal law.The law would also be revised so that those who promote or encourage such activities are also in violation of the law. One provision calls for the law to be amended to ""prohibit the dissemination of information that permits release (emission) of money substitutes and (or) the operation with their use.""The latest language in the draft bill confirms fears long harbored by many other Russian market observers.Artem Tolkachev, managing partner at the law firm Tolkachev & Partners, who has spoken publicly at Russian bitcoin conferences and who advises bitcoin startups on local regulation, told CoinDesk in September that he was pessimistic the law might only apply to those seeking to exchange fiat money for digital currencies.In particular, Толкачев pointed to statements from the Ministry of Finance in September that suggested the bill might make this interpretation. The statement read:Толкачев also pointed to the gradual evolution in statements from Russian authorities as well as the milder positions of the Bank of Russia, the country's central bank.Image via Shutterstock",2014-10-03
16408,"Crypto-finance company Epiphyte has won the SWIFT Innotribe Startup Competition at the Sibos 2014 technology and innovation trade show in Boston.The company earned the competition's $50,000 ‘Top Startup’ award with cBridge, its first crypto product targeted at international banking and financial institutions.EpiphyteCEO and founder Edan Yago said it was “very gratifying” to win the prize at the world’s largest banking convention. He added that banks, bitcoin and other distributed ledger systems have a lot to learn from each other.Epiphyte specialises in distributed ledger solutions for the mainstream financial system with the broader goal of connecting banking networks with cryptocurrency networks.Following the win, Yago said:Epiphyte’s cBridge beat out 280 competing FinTech startups. The criteria were simple: judges were asked to determine the likeliest startup to have the biggest impact on the future of the financial industry.Each of the semi-finalists pitched their ideas to audiences that would decide which of the startups would be invited to the Sibos Grand Finale at Sibos for global exposure and receive the cash prize.Kevin Johnson, SWIFT Innotribe Startup Challenge manager, suggested that while his product may have sold itself, Yago's pitch to the attendees was equally compelling, saying:Epiphyte technology allows banks to facilitate consumer-to-merchant payments using cryptocurrencies. Bank customers can perform the transactions in familiar fiat currencies like dollars and euros, and the banks themselves do not have to hold cryptocurrencies.Jo Lang, Epiphyte’s product lead and co-founder, said as many as 500 million bank customers are now able to make purchases using this new payment rail.“Epiphyte is helping our banking customers see additional revenue by providing a service that a growing number of customers want,” said Lang.The solution was designed to offer a low level of risk and compliance. Banks can use Epiphyte software to integrate crptocurrencies with traditional protocols like SWIFT.The company, founded in 2013, plans to roll out a pilot implementation of its new product sometime in the next few months.This article was co-authored by Stan HigginsImages via Epiphyte; Shutterstock",2014-10-03
16409,"UPDATE (22nd Oct): A version of the working paper, co-authored by Noyen, Volland, Fleisch and Wörner can be found here.As sportswear giant Nike expands its wearable technology applications, it will need more data to feed its gadgets and software.To do that will be a simple matter in the future. A Nike executive will simply pull up a list of sensors operated by a private weather station, selecting the ones from which she would like to buy data.With a click, the executive will pay individual sensors – perhaps thermostats mounted in a Central Park pathway particularly favoured by joggers – for their data, using bitcoin.The weather sensors will be just one part of a future market filled with data collected by machines on the 'Internet of Things'. The only difference would be that humans will now be able to pay the machines directly for their work, in bitcoin.That's the scenario described in a new paper by two researchers in Switzerland, titled, When Your Sensor Earns Money: Exchanging Data for Cash with Bitcoin. The paper was presented at UbiComp, an annual conference on 'ubiquitous and pervasive' computing organised by the Association for Computing Machinery. The event was held in Seattle last month.The paper sketches a theoretical framework for sensors to interact with the bitcoin block chain and to receive payments in exchange for their data. This would solve the current problem of growing but silo-ed sensor networks whose owners have no incentive to share their data, the paper says. The authors write:The paper's authors are Dominic Wörner and Thomas von Bomhard, researchers at the Bosch Internet of Things and Services Lab at the University of St. Gallen. Wörner says the original work on the concept was done at ETH Zurich, with Kay Noyen, Dirk Volland and Elgar Fleisch.The authors describe a framework consisting of software for the sensor and the human data customer, the bitcoin network and a sensor repository that would list all sensors who wish to sell their data and their bitcoin wallet addresses.A data buyer would check the sensor repository to browse the available data. Once a piece of data has been selected, she would send bitcoin to that sensor's wallet.When the sensor has received payment, it would send the data to the buyer over the bitcoin network using the OP_RETURN field. The data would be written to OP_RETURN and included in the block chain.The authors say this is a framework for 'sensing-as-a-service', a play on the popular software-as-a-service model deployed by firms like Salesforce.com.They point out that their current framework has several problems, including bloating the block chain with sold data and leaving the data open to free-riding because it's publicly viewable on the block chain.Still, they remain optimistic about the chances for a ""world-wide data market"", concluding:Bosch, an engineering and electronics conglomerate headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany,  is not the only corporation looking at bitcoin and the Internet of Things. Technology giant IBM revealed last month that it too is developing an open-source platform called Adept that will use block chain technology.Image via Shutterstock",2014-10-03
16410,"A year on from the arrest of Silk Road's alleged founder, CoinDesk takes a look at how the man at the centre of the scandal is dividing opinions in the bitcoin space.A lot of people in the bitcoin realm have strong opinions on Ross Ulbricht. To some, he's a libertarian hero, to others, he's a villain, intent on making his millions off the back of murder, narcotics and other nefarious goods and means.Arrested a year ago this week, Ulbricht – if you listen to the FBI's version of events – masterminded and operated anonymous online drug bazaar Silk Road under the pseudonym 'Dread Pirate Roberts' (DPR).The site didn't only facilitate the purchase of drugs (using bitcoin), but weapons, fake passports, forgeries and much more.The FBI's portrayal of Ulbricht as a dangerous criminal couldn't be further from the picture painted by the 30-year-old's friends and family.Those who know Ulbricht describe him as highly intelligent, kind, peace-loving and generous. His nearest and dearest assert that he had never before had even the slightest brush with the law, with his housemate René Pinnell telling The Verge there must be a case of mistaken identity.""I don’t know how they got Ross wrapped into this, but I’m sure it’s not him,” he said.— Free_Ross (@Free_Ross) October 1, 2014Despite the protestations of Ulbricht's friends and family, the Texas native has been incarcerated for a year now and is currently awaiting trial, charged with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. He has protested his innocence all along, claiming he is not DPR.Some big names in the bitcoin industry are divided when it comes to their opinions on Ulbricht and the site he supposedly controlled.Roger Veris one of Ulbricht's staunchest supporters, having pledged $160,000 to the Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund.Ver believes that, if Ulbricht is indeed behind Silk Road, he should be applauded, not condemned, for creating a platform that enables people to buy and sell what they please without restriction or surveillance.""Ross is accused of providing a platform that allowed peaceful people to engage in peaceful and voluntary trade with others, beyond the purview of the state. Serving even one day in prison for creating such a wonderful tool to advance human freedom would be unjust,"" he said.This is a view shared by Erik Voorhees, founder of bitcoin gambling site SatoshiDice. He said that, if Ulbricht is the person the government is alleging, the only thing he's guilty of is ""being an entrepreneur who provided a voluntary service to peaceful people"".""Does such behavior warrant life in prison? Of course not, but history is replete with examples of peaceful people being locked in cages by men with guns who dislike their peaceful behaviour,"" he added.While some in the space see the closure of Silk Road and the incarceration of its alleged founder as an abomination, others view it as one of the best things that has happened to bitcoin.Stephanie Wargo, BitPay's VP of marketing, believes the closure of Silk Road helped the bitcoin cause and feels cryptocurrency's reputation has improved since the episode.""While bitcoin is in the early stages, the market has grown significantly over the past year. And throughout it all, both the currency and the network continue to thrive in so many areas,"" she explained.A spokesperson from the Bitcoin Foundation cited the prompt increase in the price of bitcoin following the closure of Silk Road as a signal that the bitcoin community regarded the site as a ""liability"".Like Wargo, the spokesperson doesn't believe the Silk Road fiasco had too much of a negative impact on the wider world's perception of bitcoin.She explained that, in 2013, VC's invested approximately $100m in bitcoin businesses. In 2014, after the Silk Road closure, VC's invested over $100m in the first two quarters alone.""Silk Road's takedown paved the way for the building of the ecosystem's infrastructure,"" the spokesperson said, adding that it actually did bitcoin a favour as it illustrated cryptocurrency is not a ""magic cloak for criminal behaviour"".Voorhees disagrees with the idea that the FBI's closure of Silk Road and arrest of its alleged founder has acted as a deterrent against the creation of similar sites.""It was clearly not a deterrent,"" he said. ""Here we are one year after Silk Road was closed. Did online drug e-commerce dwindle after that? No, it has expanded.""Voorhees cited Silk Road 2.0 as an example and said it's bigger than its predecessor ever was, adding:Crypto-anarchist Cody Wilson agrees that Silk Road's closure didn't act as a deterrent. He said it served only to show aspiring dark market operators what not to do.The solution, he said, is to not have a central point of failure – to follow bitcoin's example and create a distributed marketplace that has no central administration.Wilson, who founded Defense Distributed, an online, open-source organisation that designs firearms, said: ""With instances like OpenBazaar, there are serious attempts to have distributed, p2p markets that excise the whole one-admin, one-host problem that crippled Silk Road.""Voorhees acknowledges that the FBI's intention in arresting Ulbricht may have been to act as a deterrent, but he stressed the driving force behind the whole saga is the US government's war on drugs.The Panama resident claims this war steals billions of dollars from taxpayers in order to harm and imprison people for making voluntary choices with their own bodies.He doesn't believe it can go on for much longer, though:Ver is also vocally opposed to the war on drugs, and he believes the US is already on the path to failure.""Thanks to bitcoin, and blockchain technology, the war on drugs is 100% certain to be lost by the violent men calling themselves the state,"" he said.Ver explained that distributed new technologies like OpenBazaar will enable people to anonymously buy and sell whatever goods they please, even if the authorities class them as illegal.It seems the FBI disagrees, with an FBI spokesperson telling Forbes this time last year: ""No one is beyond the reach of the FBI. We will find you.”Whether or not this is true, and whatever the prevailing opinion about Ulbricht, DPR and Silk Road, one thing is for certain – it's the juiciest story to come out of bitcoin yet and there's no doubt it will go down in the cryptocurrency history books.Click below to view an interactive timeline of Ulbricht's legal battle.This article is part of CoinDesk’s Silk Road: One Year On series.

16412,"The Australian Senate's Economics References Committee announced this week it would hold an inquiry into bitcoin and digital currency implications, aiming to present its findings to parliament in March 2015.Chaired by Senator Sam Dastyari of the Australian Labor Party, the committee will examine the potential economic impact of digital currencies across various industries, including banking and retail.A further aim is to help decide Australia's framework for regulating and taxing digital currency-related activities, in the hope that legal clarity will see the country take a leading role in developing the new technology.Ronald Tucker, who heads industry lobby group the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA), welcomed the news and praised both Senator Dastyari and the Economics References Committee for its foresight on the matter.In a statement, Tucker said:By encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship, he said, Australia's parliament will help create more jobs and make the country a financial technology leader.Tucker also called for ""a correction"" to Australia's current tax treatment of bitcoin provided by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) in August.Many in Australia's bitcoin industry expressed dismay at the definition of digital currencies as a taxable supply, a condition that adds 10% to the price of bitcoins sold on Australian exchanges and forces businesses to keep detailed records of transactions and price fluctuations.In August , the ATO defined bitcoin and digital currencies under existing tax laws, which subjects them to Australia's Goods and Services Tax (GST) for sales and Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in a manner similar to assets such as equities.Exchange and payment processor CoinJar posted on its blog that bitcoin sales to customers would include 10% GST starting 3rd October.For customers converting bitcoin to Australian dollars, it said, ""the guidance is more complicated"". People converting bitcoin for personal use up to $10,000 would not be subject to tax, but anyone selling bitcoin on behalf of a GST-registered business would need to keep tax invoices for every transaction.CoinJar also joined the call for changes to tax rules:The ADCCA is promoting a self-regulatory approach to digital currency industry governance, stating the following in a newsletter:Australia will host a summit for G20 nations in Brisbane this coming November, and Tucker sees this as a great opportunity to discuss issues surrounding new currency concepts in a formal setting; hopefully, he said, with Australia as the leading voice.The ADCCA also participated in last month's Responsible Finance Forum in Perth, organised in part by the World Bank, IMF and G20. Digital currencies and surrounding issues were ""very much a hot topic"" at the event, the association said, adding that was a forerunner to the main summit.Australian Senate image via Shutterstock",2014-10-03
16413,"Embattled bitcoin mining manufacturer Butterfly Labs has announced that it will resume limited business operations following discussions with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).The Missouri-based company will not be allowed to serve new consumers when it reopens, and will be restricted to fulfilling existing customer orders. Butterfly Labs further confirmed it will remain under the direction of a court-appointed receiver who will oversee the business.Butterfly Labssuggested that it aims to use this opportunity to rebuild its market perception, which it acknowledged has been impacted by the recent FTC actions.The company wrote:The announcement follows a report from The Kansas City Star that suggested Butterfly Labs was holding initial discussions with the FTC about reopening its business earlier this week.However, the actions by the FTC may not be a validation of the company and its efforts. In past filings, the FTC has indicated that Butterfly Labs should be awarded ancillary relief only as necessary to reduce the likelihood of consumer injury.Butterfly Labs said that though it is pleased with the announcement, it still finds past statements by the FTC to be contentious.The company wrote:New documents in the case filed on 27th September levied such allegations against the company, suggesting that Butterfly Labs conducted extended testing of its machines after they were purchased by customers to profit from their production.The FTC has also claimed that Butterfly Labs employees profited from mining rigs that were returned by customers or left in company custody after the consumer was issued a refund.Butterfly Labs ended its statements by acknowledging the furor around the company in recent weeks, thanking those who have stood by its business.""Butterfly Labs thanks its many customers, employees and business partners for staying with us during this challenging time,"" the statement reads.Prior to its shutdown, Butterfly Labs was besieged by manufacturing delays and customer complaints, however, it was an early market leader, having been in operation since 2010.Butterfly Labs was formally shut down in late September following months of customer complaints that it failed to deliver products as advertised.CoinDesk has reached out to the FTC for comment, but has not received an immediate response.Image via Shutterstock",2014-10-03
16414,"More than 20 merchants in Madrid's busiest shopping district will open for a Bitcoin Boulevard-style event today.While streets in Arnhem, The Hague and Cleveland have all hosted similar bitcoin awareness initiatives, organiser Félix Montero says his event, Calle Bitcoin, will be the world’s biggest yet.Around 200 bitcoin users are expected to attend the two-day spectacle, which is to feature a pub crawl, treasure hunt and photo competition, alongside giveaways in the digital currency.While Spain’s bitcoin community is small, Montero hopes the outdoor event will showcase the currency’s purchasing power and utility to those in the ""offline"" world.“We thought a bitcoin street was the best way to prove that bitcoin payments stand up even to the pressure of a crowded bar or shop in speed and flexibility,” he said.The 'calle' itself is located at luxury shopping hotspot Serrano Street – also known as the city’s ‘Gold Mile’.Besides the usual coffee shops, bars and restaurants, the 1.5 km area also features an international fashion boutique, a design hotel, an architect practice and – bizarrely – a gynaecologist.Montero explained:The event is largely experimental, involving all kinds of payment mechanisms, apps and processors, both better- and lesser-known, Montero said.Though BitPay, Blockchain and Coinbase are ‘gold’ sponsors, smaller regional startups such as Coinffeine, Avatar BTC and Bitcoin Spain, owner of the country's first Robocoin ATM, will be out in force to greet passers-by.Nicolas Cary, Blockchain’s CEO, praised the event for its commitment to the local bitcoin community, stating: “Calle Bitcoin is a perfect example of how grass roots efforts are making a big difference locally.""Moe Levin, director of European business development at BitPay, echoed this sentiment – adding that events like this underscore both the technology's ethos and its community:Calle's 13 volunteers have been instrumental in getting the project off the ground, often taking time out from their full-time jobs to visit prospective merchants and give tutorials on bitcoin point-of-sale systems.Fernando Bitti Loureiro, a regular at bitcoin meetups in Madrid, sees the project as an opportunity to dispel common misconceptions about the digital currency first-hand. He added:Another volunteer, Santiago Márquez Solís, is hoping to engage visitors with his Flappy Bird-inspired android game. Unlike the original however, players must navigate through a series of fast-moving buildings using their bitcoin avatar. After crashing (inevitably very quickly) they are greeted with information about shops participating in the event.In the spirit of open-source development, the whole project has been documented on popular forum Bitcoin Talk since its inception. Montero hopes that fellow Spanish-speakers will use these conversations as a blueprint to create their own events in the future.Calle's own future looks promising too, as each merchant has pledged to continue accepting bitcoin for at least three months after this week's event.Montero is confident many will stick with the currency past this point, and hopes to scale up in 2015, adding:Images via Calle Bitcoin and VICTOR TORRES / Shutterstock.com",2014-10-02
16415,"Deckbound is a lot like other collectible card games – the most well-known of which is Magic: The Gathering, which is played online and on tabletops. The difference is that each Deckbound card exists as a transaction on the block chain.The Isle of Man-based maker of Deckbound, EVA Plexus, is run by founder Gareth Jenkins, who has run an independent game development studio in the past.Jenkins said block chain-linked cards allow players to trade them without the involvement of the game-maker, harking back to when CCGs first came on the scene as purely paper-based games.""Because cards were physically printed, you ended up with all these interesting systems that exist in the communities around the cards. For example, most Magic [tournament] rules came from players themselves, not Wizards of the Coast,"" he said, referring to the company that created Magic.Jenkins said fusing cards to the block chain means that each card would then become a permanent digital object that would be independent of its maker.""By basing it on the block chain [...] we provide a level of guarantee to players that if, for whatever reason, in two years our business goes bust, everything is still public,"" he said.This is a departure from the conventional way online CCGs are managed, where the publisher acts as the central authority issuing new cards, deciding how cards can be traded and ensuring that the systems are in place to sustain the game world.He added:Digital CCGs are proving to be major money-makers for big game publishers.Hasbro, which owns Magic's maker Wizards of the Coast, reported $1.3bn in sales from its game division in 2013, representing growth of 10% over the previous year. The games and toys giant doesn't break out figures for individual titles, but singled out Magic for contributing to its revenue gains.Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard, which owns the hugely popular World of Warcraft and Diablo franchises, launched its own online CCG, Hearthstone, in March. The company said it expected Hearthstone to exceed $100m in revenues, with Blizzard Entertainment chief executive Michael Morhaime saying the title ""has been exceeding all of our expectations"", in an August earnings call with investors.Jenkins has had to perform some complicated manoeuvres to link Deckbound cards to the block chain. For starters, he built a system that allows various tags to be attached to a bitcoin transaction, called BitBind. The system can be thought of as a simplified implementation of coloured coins, Jenkins said.The BitBind system is used by Deckbound to attach various card attributes to a given transaction, effectively turning that transaction into a Deckbound card.""BitBind allows us to follow things around the block chain [...] it allows players to freely trade cards; it doesn't involve us, but we still know where [the cards] are, and so on,"" Jenkins said.Because each Deckbound card is essentially a bitcoin transaction, it also has a nominal bitcoin value, which is a percentage of the price of that card. The first Deckbound cards are priced at $1 worth of bitcoin, so each card has a value of $0.25 worth of bitcoin.The BitBind system sits on top of the block chain, so it doesn't write any information to the bitcoin public ledger. It is currently hosted by Jenkins' company and its accessible through an API. Jenkins said the plan is to make the project open-source and available to anyone to run in the long-term.Deckbound's next link to the block chain is its crowdfunding scheme. Jenkins is trying to raise funds for the game by turning cards into return-yielding assets.Instead of issuing new cards and slapping a price tag on them, Deckbound cards are issued from a 'genesis block'. Each block is released when it hits a funding target. Investors who fund the block then stand to earn a return as the card is traded among players, gaining or losing value.The first block has raised 30.4 BTC, putting it at 41% of its funding target of 75 BTC. The minimum projected return, according to Deckbound's website, is 130% of the principal invested.Collectible cards have long been traded on marketplaces, fetching sky-high prices. The most expensive Magic card on record sold on eBay last year for more than $27,000, while the most expensive Pokemon trading card was on the block for $100,000 last September.Deckbound is also selling cards ahead of its release in an 'alpha' stage of development this year. The game can be played for free with 'Nomad' cards supplied by the game-maker, but packs of cards can also be purchased, with prices starting at $5.According to Jenkins, 5,000 cards have already been sold, worth about 2.5 BTC in all.""The response we've had so far has been great,"" he said.One gaming enthusiast on Bitcointalk, who is a self-professed player of Magic and Hearthstone, had this to say about Deckbound's concept:Part of the reason Jenkins is bootstrapping the game is because he's encountered difficulty finding investors who are comfortable both in the cryptocurrency world and in the gaming space – although failed exchange Mt Gox, notably, started life as a trading platform for Magic cards.Jenkins described one conversation with a prominent Silicon Valley investor who was clued-in on bitcoin, but struggled to understand the market for online card games. Still, he said he was hopeful he would be in a better position to raise traditional funding if the game gets some traction with customers first.Feature image via Shutterstock",2014-10-02
16416,"Coinbase has expanded its European presence to an additional five countries following the launch of its services in the region early last month.The moveallows consumers in Denmark, Ireland, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland to buy and sell up to €500 in bitcoin through Coinbase.The US-based bitcoin services provider initially rolled out services to Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Malta, Portugal and Slovakia.Coinbase has also increased the daily buy and sell limits to €2,000 for its users in France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland.Coinbasehas emerged as a frontrunner in the US market for bitcoin service providers, with more than 1.6 million users subscribing to its wallet service and billion-dollar corporations like Overstock, Expedia and DISH integrating its merchant services.By expanding into Europe, the company aims to underscore bitcoin’s cross-border payments potential and bring bitcoin buying capabilities to new markets.The news comes as a number of similar bitcoin brokerage services are seeking to serve the broader European market.Last week, Coinify announced an undisclosed, multimillion-dollar investment from SEED Capital, which it told CoinDesk it intends to use to extend its processing services to merchants, as well as its buy and sell services to consumers.Similarly, the UK- and Lithuania-based SpectroCoin recently launched its bitcoin merchant processing solution for the Europe, building on its existing brokerage services.Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Vytautas Karalevičius talked about the importance of economies of scale as one motivator for providing an all-encompassing bitcoin services solution – wallet, exchange and merchant services.Though Coinbase has not formally made the European market part of its merchant acquisition strategy, a number of startups are already establishing themselves in this area, meaning there could be competition should the company choose to do so.A number of large European companies accept bitcoin through Paymium, a European startup that services roughly 600,000 users, offering a bitcoin exchange as well as bitcoin payment processing tools for merchants.On Tuesday, French online fashion retailer Showroomprive began offering bitcoin payments to its customers, becoming Paymium’s largest merchant client and Europe’s largest bitcoin merchant.Further, Coinbase's largest competitor in the North American merchant processing space, BitPay, is already making Europe a priority, allegedly adding 200 regional merchants to its service each week.Images via Coinbase; Shutterstock",2014-10-02
16417,"The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation has released the full version of the draft bill that, if passed in current form, would effectively ban the creation and distribution of software that allows for the use of money substitutes, including bitcoin and all digital currencies.First announced as a proposal in August, the news marks the first time that the Ministry of Finance has made the proposed law public, as well as its definition of ""money surrogates"" under which bitcoin and digital currencies may be prohibited.The two-page draft bill details a series of administrative fines to be imposed on both businesses and private citizens who issue, create or deliberately disseminate information about the release or operation of digital currencies, the language implying that the law would apply to much of the bitcoin industry, from bitcoin users to miners and service providers.For example, individuals who are found to issue or create bitcoin or digital currencies will be penalized with fines of 30,000–50,000 rubles ($750–$1,250). Similarly, officials found to engage in such practices will be subject to fines of 60,000–100,000 rubles ($1,500–$2,500), while legal entities will be eligible for fines of 500,000–1m rubles ($12,500–$25,000).A similar series of fines is also detailed for those found to have disseminated information that ""permits the release of money substitutes"". Individuals engaging in this practice would be subject to fines 5,000–50,000 rubles ($125–$1,250); officials, 20,000–100,000 rubles ($500–$2,500); and legal entities 500,000–1m rubles ($12,500–$25,000).At press time, much of the domestic industry was still reacting to the news. Anton Vereshchagin, founder of InterMoneyExchange, which had planned to launch in Russia but has since moved to other markets, told CoinDesk:He added: ""In fact, the restrictions and prohibitions are only getting worse.""The draft bill also calls for the amendment of the definition of money surrogates in Russia to include language that would cover new financial technologies such as digital currencies.Under the revision, the definition would include any ""monetary unit"" issued as a means of payment or exchange and not allowed under federal law.The law would also be revised so that those who promote or encourage such activities are also in violation of the law. One provision calls for the law to be amended to ""prohibit the dissemination of information that permits release (emission) of money substitutes and (or) the operation with their use.""The latest language in the draft bill confirms fears long harbored by many other Russian market observers.Artem Tolkachev, managing partner at the law firm Tolkachev & Partners, who has spoken publicly at Russian bitcoin conferences and who advises bitcoin startups on local regulation, told CoinDesk in September that he was pessimistic the law might only apply to those seeking to exchange fiat money for digital currencies.In particular, Толкачев pointed to statements from the Ministry of Finance in September that suggested the bill might make this interpretation. The statement read:Толкачев also pointed to the gradual evolution in statements from Russian authorities as well as the milder positions of the Bank of Russia, the country's central bank.Image via Shutterstock",2014-10-03
16418,"Crypto-finance company Epiphyte has won the SWIFT Innotribe Startup Competition at the Sibos 2014 technology and innovation trade show in Boston.The company earned the competition's $50,000 ‘Top Startup’ award with cBridge, its first crypto product targeted at international banking and financial institutions.EpiphyteCEO and founder Edan Yago said it was “very gratifying” to win the prize at the world’s largest banking convention. He added that banks, bitcoin and other distributed ledger systems have a lot to learn from each other.Epiphyte specialises in distributed ledger solutions for the mainstream financial system with the broader goal of connecting banking networks with cryptocurrency networks.Following the win, Yago said:Epiphyte’s cBridge beat out 280 competing FinTech startups. The criteria were simple: judges were asked to determine the likeliest startup to have the biggest impact on the future of the financial industry.Each of the semi-finalists pitched their ideas to audiences that would decide which of the startups would be invited to the Sibos Grand Finale at Sibos for global exposure and receive the cash prize.Kevin Johnson, SWIFT Innotribe Startup Challenge manager, suggested that while his product may have sold itself, Yago's pitch to the attendees was equally compelling, saying:Epiphyte technology allows banks to facilitate consumer-to-merchant payments using cryptocurrencies. Bank customers can perform the transactions in familiar fiat currencies like dollars and euros, and the banks themselves do not have to hold cryptocurrencies.Jo Lang, Epiphyte’s product lead and co-founder, said as many as 500 million bank customers are now able to make purchases using this new payment rail.“Epiphyte is helping our banking customers see additional revenue by providing a service that a growing number of customers want,” said Lang.The solution was designed to offer a low level of risk and compliance. Banks can use Epiphyte software to integrate crptocurrencies with traditional protocols like SWIFT.The company, founded in 2013, plans to roll out a pilot implementation of its new product sometime in the next few months.This article was co-authored by Stan HigginsImages via Epiphyte; Shutterstock",2014-10-03
16419,"UPDATE (22nd Oct): A version of the working paper, co-authored by Noyen, Volland, Fleisch and Wörner can be found here.As sportswear giant Nike expands its wearable technology applications, it will need more data to feed its gadgets and software.To do that will be a simple matter in the future. A Nike executive will simply pull up a list of sensors operated by a private weather station, selecting the ones from which she would like to buy data.With a click, the executive will pay individual sensors – perhaps thermostats mounted in a Central Park pathway particularly favoured by joggers – for their data, using bitcoin.The weather sensors will be just one part of a future market filled with data collected by machines on the 'Internet of Things'. The only difference would be that humans will now be able to pay the machines directly for their work, in bitcoin.That's the scenario described in a new paper by two researchers in Switzerland, titled, When Your Sensor Earns Money: Exchanging Data for Cash with Bitcoin. The paper was presented at UbiComp, an annual conference on 'ubiquitous and pervasive' computing organised by the Association for Computing Machinery. The event was held in Seattle last month.The paper sketches a theoretical framework for sensors to interact with the bitcoin block chain and to receive payments in exchange for their data. This would solve the current problem of growing but silo-ed sensor networks whose owners have no incentive to share their data, the paper says. The authors write:The paper's authors are Dominic Wörner and Thomas von Bomhard, researchers at the Bosch Internet of Things and Services Lab at the University of St. Gallen. Wörner says the original work on the concept was done at ETH Zurich, with Kay Noyen, Dirk Volland and Elgar Fleisch.The authors describe a framework consisting of software for the sensor and the human data customer, the bitcoin network and a sensor repository that would list all sensors who wish to sell their data and their bitcoin wallet addresses.A data buyer would check the sensor repository to browse the available data. Once a piece of data has been selected, she would send bitcoin to that sensor's wallet.When the sensor has received payment, it would send the data to the buyer over the bitcoin network using the OP_RETURN field. The data would be written to OP_RETURN and included in the block chain.The authors say this is a framework for 'sensing-as-a-service', a play on the popular software-as-a-service model deployed by firms like Salesforce.com.They point out that their current framework has several problems, including bloating the block chain with sold data and leaving the data open to free-riding because it's publicly viewable on the block chain.Still, they remain optimistic about the chances for a ""world-wide data market"", concluding:Bosch, an engineering and electronics conglomerate headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany,  is not the only corporation looking at bitcoin and the Internet of Things. Technology giant IBM revealed last month that it too is developing an open-source platform called Adept that will use block chain technology.Image via Shutterstock",2014-10-03

To some, he's a libertarian hero, to others, he's a villain, intent on making his millions off the back of murder, narcotics and other nefarious goods and means.Arrested a year ago this week, Ulbricht – if you listen to the FBI's version of events – masterminded and operated anonymous online drug bazaar Silk Road under the pseudonym 'Dread Pirate Roberts' (DPR).The site didn't only facilitate the purchase of drugs (using bitcoin), but weapons, fake passports, forgeries and much more.The FBI's portrayal of Ulbricht as a dangerous criminal couldn't be further from the picture painted by the 30-year-old's friends and family.Those who know Ulbricht describe him as highly intelligent, kind, peace-loving and generous. His nearest and dearest assert that he had never before had even the slightest brush with the law, with his housemate René Pinnell telling The Verge there must be a case of mistaken identity.""I don’t know how they got Ross wrapped into this, but I’m sure it’s not him,” he said.— Free_Ross (@Free_Ross) October 1, 2014Despite the protestations of Ulbricht's friends and family, the Texas native has been incarcerated for a year now and is currently awaiting trial, charged with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. He has protested his innocence all along, claiming he is not DPR.Some big names in the bitcoin industry are divided when it comes to their opinions on Ulbricht and the site he supposedly controlled.Roger Veris one of Ulbricht's staunchest supporters, having pledged $160,000 to the Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund.Ver believes that, if Ulbricht is indeed behind Silk Road, he should be applauded, not condemned, for creating a platform that enables people to buy and sell what they please without restriction or surveillance.""Ross is accused of providing a platform that allowed peaceful people to engage in peaceful and voluntary trade with others, beyond the purview of the state. Serving even one day in prison for creating such a wonderful tool to advance human freedom would be unjust,"" he said.This is a view shared by Erik Voorhees, founder of bitcoin gambling site SatoshiDice. He said that, if Ulbricht is the person the government is alleging, the only thing he's guilty of is ""being an entrepreneur who provided a voluntary service to peaceful people"".""Does such behavior warrant life in prison? Of course not, but history is replete with examples of peaceful people being locked in cages by men with guns who dislike their peaceful behaviour,"" he added.While some in the space see the closure of Silk Road and the incarceration of its alleged founder as an abomination, others view it as one of the best things that has happened to bitcoin.Stephanie Wargo, BitPay's VP of marketing, believes the closure of Silk Road helped the bitcoin cause and feels cryptocurrency's reputation has improved since the episode.""While bitcoin is in the early stages, the market has grown significantly over the past year. And throughout it all, both the currency and the network continue to thrive in so many areas,"" she explained.A spokesperson from the Bitcoin Foundation cited the prompt increase in the price of bitcoin following the closure of Silk Road as a signal that the bitcoin community regarded the site as a ""liability"".Like Wargo, the spokesperson doesn't believe the Silk Road fiasco had too much of a negative impact on the wider world's perception of bitcoin.She explained that, in 2013, VC's invested approximately $100m in bitcoin businesses. In 2014, after the Silk Road closure, VC's invested over $100m in the first two quarters alone.""Silk Road's takedown paved the way for the building of the ecosystem's infrastructure,"" the spokesperson said, adding that it actually did bitcoin a favour as it illustrated cryptocurrency is not a ""magic cloak for criminal behaviour"".Voorhees disagrees with the idea that the FBI's closure of Silk Road and arrest of its alleged founder has acted as a deterrent against the creation of similar sites.""It was clearly not a deterrent,"" he said. ""Here we are one year after Silk Road was closed. Did online drug e-commerce dwindle after that? No, it has expanded.""Voorhees cited Silk Road 2.0 as an example and said it's bigger than its predecessor ever was, adding:Crypto-anarchist Cody Wilson agrees that Silk Road's closure didn't act as a deterrent. He said it served only to show aspiring dark market operators what not to do.The solution, he said, is to not have a central point of failure – to follow bitcoin's example and create a distributed marketplace that has no central administration.Wilson, who founded Defense Distributed, an online, open-source organisation that designs firearms, said: ""With instances like OpenBazaar, there are serious attempts to have distributed, p2p markets that excise the whole one-admin, one-host problem that crippled Silk Road.""Voorhees acknowledges that the FBI's intention in arresting Ulbricht may have been to act as a deterrent, but he stressed the driving force behind the whole saga is the US government's war on drugs.The Panama resident claims this war steals billions of dollars from taxpayers in order to harm and imprison people for making voluntary choices with their own bodies.He doesn't believe it can go on for much longer, though:Ver is also vocally opposed to the war on drugs, and he believes the US is already on the path to failure.""Thanks to bitcoin, and blockchain technology, the war on drugs is 100% certain to be lost by the violent men calling themselves the state,"" he said.Ver explained that distributed new technologies like OpenBazaar will enable people to anonymously buy and sell whatever goods they please, even if the authorities class them as illegal.It seems the FBI disagrees, with an FBI spokesperson telling Forbes this time last year: ""No one is beyond the reach of the FBI. We will find you.”Whether or not this is true, and whatever the prevailing opinion about Ulbricht, DPR and Silk Road, one thing is for certain – it's the juiciest story to come out of bitcoin yet and there's no doubt it will go down in the cryptocurrency history books.Click below to view an interactive timeline of Ulbricht's legal battle.This article is part of CoinDesk’s Silk Road: One Year On series.

16421,"A year has passed since the FBI shut down black marketplace Silk Road and arrested its alleged founder, Ross William Ulbricht.Much has happened in the bitcoin world since these events, yet the shadow of Silk Road still hangs over the industry.Twelve months later, it remains an influence on bitcoin’s mainstream perception, the proposed regulation targeting the industry and the entrepreneurs and developers working in the space.Whether you believe Silk Road to be another speed bump on bitcoin’s road to mass adoption or a black mark that could threaten its future, it is never far from the discussion. Meanwhile, Ulbricht’s case is still ongoing and online, bitcoin-enabled drug bazaars are flourishing more than ever.This week, to mark the anniversary of Silk Road's end, CoinDesk takes a look at how the site rocked the bitcoin world and created shockwaves that are still being felt today.Silk Road: One Year Onwill bring you a collection of features, interactive timelines and articles about Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht and the mysterious world that is the dark web.You'll gain insight into what the big names in the bitcoin space really think about Ulbricht’s ongoing legal battle and you’ll hear from his mother, Lyn, about why, one year later, she won’t stop fighting for her son’s freedom.Not only that, but you’ll get the chance to learn more about the dark web and how this corner of the Internet appears to be growing, despite Silk Road’s demise and the attempts of law enforcement agencies.Look out for part one of Silk Road: One Year On later today.To refresh your memory of the full Silk Road story, check out our interactive timeline below:",2014-10-03
16422,"The Australian Senate's Economics References Committee announced this week it would hold an inquiry into bitcoin and digital currency implications, aiming to present its findings to parliament in March 2015.Chaired by Senator Sam Dastyari of the Australian Labor Party, the committee will examine the potential economic impact of digital currencies across various industries, including banking and retail.A further aim is to help decide Australia's framework for regulating and taxing digital currency-related activities, in the hope that legal clarity will see the country take a leading role in developing the new technology.Ronald Tucker, who heads industry lobby group the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA), welcomed the news and praised both Senator Dastyari and the Economics References Committee for its foresight on the matter.In a statement, Tucker said:By encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship, he said, Australia's parliament will help create more jobs and make the country a financial technology leader.Tucker also called for ""a correction"" to Australia's current tax treatment of bitcoin provided by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) in August.Many in Australia's bitcoin industry expressed dismay at the definition of digital currencies as a taxable supply, a condition that adds 10% to the price of bitcoins sold on Australian exchanges and forces businesses to keep detailed records of transactions and price fluctuations.In August , the ATO defined bitcoin and digital currencies under existing tax laws, which subjects them to Australia's Goods and Services Tax (GST) for sales and Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in a manner similar to assets such as equities.Exchange and payment processor CoinJar posted on its blog that bitcoin sales to customers would include 10% GST starting 3rd October.For customers converting bitcoin to Australian dollars, it said, ""the guidance is more complicated"". People converting bitcoin for personal use up to $10,000 would not be subject to tax, but anyone selling bitcoin on behalf of a GST-registered business would need to keep tax invoices for every transaction.CoinJar also joined the call for changes to tax rules:The ADCCA is promoting a self-regulatory approach to digital currency industry governance, stating the following in a newsletter:Australia will host a summit for G20 nations in Brisbane this coming November, and Tucker sees this as a great opportunity to discuss issues surrounding new currency concepts in a formal setting; hopefully, he said, with Australia as the leading voice.The ADCCA also participated in last month's Responsible Finance Forum in Perth, organised in part by the World Bank, IMF and G20. Digital currencies and surrounding issues were ""very much a hot topic"" at the event, the association said, adding that was a forerunner to the main summit.Australian Senate image via Shutterstock",2014-10-03
16423,"Embattled bitcoin mining manufacturer Butterfly Labs has announced that it will resume limited business operations following discussions with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).The Missouri-based company will not be allowed to serve new consumers when it reopens, and will be restricted to fulfilling existing customer orders. Butterfly Labs further confirmed it will remain under the direction of a court-appointed receiver who will oversee the business.Butterfly Labssuggested that it aims to use this opportunity to rebuild its market perception, which it acknowledged has been impacted by the recent FTC actions.The company wrote:The announcement follows a report from The Kansas City Star that suggested Butterfly Labs was holding initial discussions with the FTC about reopening its business earlier this week.However, the actions by the FTC may not be a validation of the company and its efforts. In past filings, the FTC has indicated that Butterfly Labs should be awarded ancillary relief only as necessary to reduce the likelihood of consumer injury.Butterfly Labs said that though it is pleased with the announcement, it still finds past statements by the FTC to be contentious.The company wrote:New documents in the case filed on 27th September levied such allegations against the company, suggesting that Butterfly Labs conducted extended testing of its machines after they were purchased by customers to profit from their production.The FTC has also claimed that Butterfly Labs employees profited from mining rigs that were returned by customers or left in company custody after the consumer was issued a refund.Butterfly Labs ended its statements by acknowledging the furor around the company in recent weeks, thanking those who have stood by its business.""Butterfly Labs thanks its many customers, employees and business partners for staying with us during this challenging time,"" the statement reads.Prior to its shutdown, Butterfly Labs was besieged by manufacturing delays and customer complaints, however, it was an early market leader, having been in operation since 2010.Butterfly Labs was formally shut down in late September following months of customer complaints that it failed to deliver products as advertised.CoinDesk has reached out to the FTC for comment, but has not received an immediate response.Image via Shutterstock",2014-10-03
16424,"More than 20 merchants in Madrid's busiest shopping district will open for a Bitcoin Boulevard-style event today.While streets in Arnhem, The Hague and Cleveland have all hosted similar bitcoin awareness initiatives, organiser Félix Montero says his event, Calle Bitcoin, will be the world’s biggest yet.Around 200 bitcoin users are expected to attend the two-day spectacle, which is to feature a pub crawl, treasure hunt and photo competition, alongside giveaways in the digital currency.While Spain’s bitcoin community is small, Montero hopes the outdoor event will showcase the currency’s purchasing power and utility to those in the ""offline"" world.“We thought a bitcoin street was the best way to prove that bitcoin payments stand up even to the pressure of a crowded bar or shop in speed and flexibility,” he said.The 'calle' itself is located at luxury shopping hotspot Serrano Street – also known as the city’s ‘Gold Mile’.Besides the usual coffee shops, bars and restaurants, the 1.5 km area also features an international fashion boutique, a design hotel, an architect practice and – bizarrely – a gynaecologist.Montero explained:The event is largely experimental, involving all kinds of payment mechanisms, apps and processors, both better- and lesser-known, Montero said.Though BitPay, Blockchain and Coinbase are ‘gold’ sponsors, smaller regional startups such as Coinffeine, Avatar BTC and Bitcoin Spain, owner of the country's first Robocoin ATM, will be out in force to greet passers-by.Nicolas Cary, Blockchain’s CEO, praised the event for its commitment to the local bitcoin community, stating: “Calle Bitcoin is a perfect example of how grass roots efforts are making a big difference locally.""Moe Levin, director of European business development at BitPay, echoed this sentiment – adding that events like this underscore both the technology's ethos and its community:Calle's 13 volunteers have been instrumental in getting the project off the ground, often taking time out from their full-time jobs to visit prospective merchants and give tutorials on bitcoin point-of-sale systems.Fernando Bitti Loureiro, a regular at bitcoin meetups in Madrid, sees the project as an opportunity to dispel common misconceptions about the digital currency first-hand. He added:Another volunteer, Santiago Márquez Solís, is hoping to engage visitors with his Flappy Bird-inspired android game. Unlike the original however, players must navigate through a series of fast-moving buildings using their bitcoin avatar. After crashing (inevitably very quickly) they are greeted with information about shops participating in the event.In the spirit of open-source development, the whole project has been documented on popular forum Bitcoin Talk since its inception. Montero hopes that fellow Spanish-speakers will use these conversations as a blueprint to create their own events in the future.Calle's own future looks promising too, as each merchant has pledged to continue accepting bitcoin for at least three months after this week's event.Montero is confident many will stick with the currency past this point, and hopes to scale up in 2015, adding:Images via Calle Bitcoin and VICTOR TORRES / Shutterstock.com",2014-10-02
16425,"Deckbound is a lot like other collectible card games – the most well-known of which is Magic: The Gathering, which is played online and on tabletops. The difference is that each Deckbound card exists as a transaction on the block chain.The Isle of Man-based maker of Deckbound, EVA Plexus, is run by founder Gareth Jenkins, who has run an independent game development studio in the past.Jenkins said block chain-linked cards allow players to trade them without the involvement of the game-maker, harking back to when CCGs first came on the scene as purely paper-based games.""Because cards were physically printed, you ended up with all these interesting systems that exist in the communities around the cards. For example, most Magic [tournament] rules came from players themselves, not Wizards of the Coast,"" he said, referring to the company that created Magic.Jenkins said fusing cards to the block chain means that each card would then become a permanent digital object that would be independent of its maker.""By basing it on the block chain [...] we provide a level of guarantee to players that if, for whatever reason, in two years our business goes bust, everything is still public,"" he said.This is a departure from the conventional way online CCGs are managed, where the publisher acts as the central authority issuing new cards, deciding how cards can be traded and ensuring that the systems are in place to sustain the game world.He added:Digital CCGs are proving to be major money-makers for big game publishers.Hasbro, which owns Magic's maker Wizards of the Coast, reported $1.3bn in sales from its game division in 2013, representing growth of 10% over the previous year. The games and toys giant doesn't break out figures for individual titles, but singled out Magic for contributing to its revenue gains.Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard, which owns the hugely popular World of Warcraft and Diablo franchises, launched its own online CCG, Hearthstone, in March. The company said it expected Hearthstone to exceed $100m in revenues, with Blizzard Entertainment chief executive Michael Morhaime saying the title ""has been exceeding all of our expectations"", in an August earnings call with investors.Jenkins has had to perform some complicated manoeuvres to link Deckbound cards to the block chain. For starters, he built a system that allows various tags to be attached to a bitcoin transaction, called BitBind. The system can be thought of as a simplified implementation of coloured coins, Jenkins said.The BitBind system is used by Deckbound to attach various card attributes to a given transaction, effectively turning that transaction into a Deckbound card.""BitBind allows us to follow things around the block chain [...] it allows players to freely trade cards; it doesn't involve us, but we still know where [the cards] are, and so on,"" Jenkins said.Because each Deckbound card is essentially a bitcoin transaction, it also has a nominal bitcoin value, which is a percentage of the price of that card. The first Deckbound cards are priced at $1 worth of bitcoin, so each card has a value of $0.25 worth of bitcoin.The BitBind system sits on top of the block chain, so it doesn't write any information to the bitcoin public ledger. It is currently hosted by Jenkins' company and its accessible through an API. Jenkins said the plan is to make the project open-source and available to anyone to run in the long-term.Deckbound's next link to the block chain is its crowdfunding scheme. Jenkins is trying to raise funds for the game by turning cards into return-yielding assets.Instead of issuing new cards and slapping a price tag on them, Deckbound cards are issued from a 'genesis block'. Each block is released when it hits a funding target. Investors who fund the block then stand to earn a return as the card is traded among players, gaining or losing value.The first block has raised 30.4 BTC, putting it at 41% of its funding target of 75 BTC. The minimum projected return, according to Deckbound's website, is 130% of the principal invested.Collectible cards have long been traded on marketplaces, fetching sky-high prices. The most expensive Magic card on record sold on eBay last year for more than $27,000, while the most expensive Pokemon trading card was on the block for $100,000 last September.Deckbound is also selling cards ahead of its release in an 'alpha' stage of development this year. The game can be played for free with 'Nomad' cards supplied by the game-maker, but packs of cards can also be purchased, with prices starting at $5.According to Jenkins, 5,000 cards have already been sold, worth about 2.5 BTC in all.""The response we've had so far has been great,"" he said.One gaming enthusiast on Bitcointalk, who is a self-professed player of Magic and Hearthstone, had this to say about Deckbound's concept:Part of the reason Jenkins is bootstrapping the game is because he's encountered difficulty finding investors who are comfortable both in the cryptocurrency world and in the gaming space – although failed exchange Mt Gox, notably, started life as a trading platform for Magic cards.Jenkins described one conversation with a prominent Silicon Valley investor who was clued-in on bitcoin, but struggled to understand the market for online card games. Still, he said he was hopeful he would be in a better position to raise traditional funding if the game gets some traction with customers first.Feature image via Shutterstock",2014-10-02
16426,"Coinbase has expanded its European presence to an additional five countries following the launch of its services in the region early last month.The moveallows consumers in Denmark, Ireland, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland to buy and sell up to €500 in bitcoin through Coinbase.The US-based bitcoin services provider initially rolled out services to Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Malta, Portugal and Slovakia.Coinbase has also increased the daily buy and sell limits to €2,000 for its users in France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland.Coinbasehas emerged as a frontrunner in the US market for bitcoin service providers, with more than 1.6 million users subscribing to its wallet service and billion-dollar corporations like Overstock, Expedia and DISH integrating its merchant services.By expanding into Europe, the company aims to underscore bitcoin’s cross-border payments potential and bring bitcoin buying capabilities to new markets.The news comes as a number of similar bitcoin brokerage services are seeking to serve the broader European market.Last week, Coinify announced an undisclosed, multimillion-dollar investment from SEED Capital, which it told CoinDesk it intends to use to extend its processing services to merchants, as well as its buy and sell services to consumers.Similarly, the UK- and Lithuania-based SpectroCoin recently launched its bitcoin merchant processing solution for the Europe, building on its existing brokerage services.Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Vytautas Karalevičius talked about the importance of economies of scale as one motivator for providing an all-encompassing bitcoin services solution – wallet, exchange and merchant services.Though Coinbase has not formally made the European market part of its merchant acquisition strategy, a number of startups are already establishing themselves in this area, meaning there could be competition should the company choose to do so.A number of large European companies accept bitcoin through Paymium, a European startup that services roughly 600,000 users, offering a bitcoin exchange as well as bitcoin payment processing tools for merchants.On Tuesday, French online fashion retailer Showroomprive began offering bitcoin payments to its customers, becoming Paymium’s largest merchant client and Europe’s largest bitcoin merchant.Further, Coinbase's largest competitor in the North American merchant processing space, BitPay, is already making Europe a priority, allegedly adding 200 regional merchants to its service each week.Images via Coinbase; Shutterstock",2014-10-02
16427,"During an interview on Bloomberg TV's ""Street Smart"" today, Bill Gates responded to new questions about bitcoin and its potential to bring innovation to the payments industry.The technology advisor at Microsoft, founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and recently crowned richest man in the world, in turn, provided short and somewhat muddled responses, though Gates addressed bitcoin more specifically than he has in the past.Calling bitcoin ""exciting"" because of its ability to provide a relatively low-cost transaction network, Gates told Bloomberg:However, while seemingly positive, Gates went on to suggest that though he believes the world needs lower-cost payments solutions, bitcoin is perhaps not the best example of how the market should look to provide this solution.Gates suggested that bitcoin may not appeal to the mass market due to its relative anonymity, as well as its associations with terrorism and money laundering.He added:The interview took place at Sibos 2014, a banking and financial conference held in Boston, where Gates also addressed the challenges facing the financial industry and the underbanked.Notably, the first day of the event was dedicated in part to highlighting developments in the digital currency industry, with representatives from Circle, Ethereum and Ripple Labs.Though brief, the statements mark an evolution in Gates' public statements on bitcoin.This February, the noted technologist and philanthropist participated in an Ask Me Anything on the social network Reddit where he was asked for his thoughts on bitcoin by multiple users.At the time, Gates largely sidestepped the issue, choosing instead to focus his praise on digital money networks like Kenya's centralized mobile service, M-Pesa.Gates addressed bitcoin only once, saying:Hat tip to BloombergImage via Bloomberg",2014-10-02

Following the introduction, eight out of the 10 candidates took to the floor to address the meeting.The majority of the ballots were cast by proxy, with a total of 54 out of the 76 eligible members taking part in the vote. Candidates needed to win more than 50% of the vote to get elected – 28 votes or more.The results were announced shortly after the vote took place. The new board replaces an interim board, which has steered the UKDCA since its formation.The five newly elected members are:Paul Gordon carried the day with a clear majority. Best known for launching Coinscrum's educational and networking events in London, he also played an instrumental role in the establishment of the UKDCA and has served as an interim board member since its creation.Tom Robinson is a prominent member of the UK cryptocurrency community, a founding member of the UKDCA and a co-founder of bitcoin storage service Elliptic. Like Jankelewitz, Robinson has also discussed bitcoin with government officials and his efforts led to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs’ (HMRC) reclassification of bitcoin for VAT purposes.""Now the hard work begins,"" he said in reaction to the news. Citing banking as a priority area for the organisation, he added that ""slow and steady progress is being made"".Adam Vaziri, the second lawyer on the board, specialises in FinTech compliance services with his company Diacle and is currently a consultant for compliance solutions provider Neopay. He expressed a desire to build alliances with other associations around the world, and to introduce new technologies and currencies to the UKDCA, including what he described as a ""self-regulatory framework"".Adam Cleary of gold-to-bitcoin exchange Bullion Bitcoin had also been an interim board member and was actively involved in the creation of the association. Cleary is also the chief executive of Coin Capital Ltd and an executive director at cryptocurrency gift voucher provider pock.io.Intellectual property lawyer Eitan Jankelewitz has been involved in a number of bitcoin projects and has worked with mining hardware manufacturers, bitcoin exchanges, developers and bitcoin-accepting retailers. A regular speaker at bitcoin events, Jankelewitz has been a member of a number of delegations engaging UK government officials in discussions about bitcoin.""A few months and a load of new members later, I’m delighted to be a part of the first elected board,"" he said, adding:""There is still a lot to be done in the UK in order to make it a welcoming place for digital currency businesses. I think it’s important that regulators and government hear a consistent message and the UKDCA should help ensure that this message takes the wider UK digital currency community’s goals into account.""Brief biographies of all 10 candidates are available on UKDCA’s website and CoinDesk's coverage of the run-up to the election can be found here.The UKDCA was officially launched on 24thMarch with the aim of promoting bitcoin adoption through public debate and helping shape growth-friendly policy and regulation for digital currency in the UK. The association is registered as a non-profit organization.At the time, Cleary described the association as a UK-centric organisation, although the UKDCA has been in touch with the Bitcoin Foundation to discuss future cooperation. However, the UKDCA is not a branch of the Bitcoin Foundation and, in some respects, is similar to the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and other regional bitcoin associations.The UKDCA currently has four working groups that specialise in different areas of digital currency.

16429,"The exchange sector is one of the corners of the digital currency economy that has seen the most radical change and developments in recent years.The evolution in the exchange industry can be traced by the rise and fall of major platforms. From the much-publicized collapse of Mt Gox to the launch of websites like Bitfinex and others that enable advanced trading activities, the exchange ecosystem has pushed new innovations and offerings and, as some might argue, will continue to do so moving forward.But how the landscape will look even months from now is a tough question to answer. Many elements of the crypto 2.0 cluster of projects point to a new breed of exchanges wherein assets of all kinds, including digital currencies, can be transferred person to person.On the other end of the spectrum, the market is beginning to see non-centralized services that users can take advantage of without even creating a unique account.ShapeShift.iois one of these services. Conceived in the winter of 2013 and launched last month, the service is, as described by creator and CEO Beorn Gonthier, like a cryptocurrency vending machine.He told CoinDesk:The website displays how much coin liquidity is available at a given time, which Gonthier said is restocked based on demand. In addition to bitcoin and litecoin, ShapeShift began offering support for dogecoin, peercoin and darkcoin yesterday.CoinDesk tested the system by trying to buy 0.007 BTC ($2.64 at today's exchange rates) worth of litecoins. The process begins with the user selecting the coin pair they wish to trade.Once the user enters their payment address, the service generates a bitcoin deposit address, as well as a working exchange rate for the currency pair. It also confirms the deposit address – a feature no doubt welcome for those concerned about irreversibly sending their bitcoins to the wrong address.After the transaction has been processed, ShapeShift offers both a link to a receipt-generation tool and access to the block chain for the cryptocurrency the user has purchased. Transaction broadcasting happens automatically and, in our case, within a few minutes the newly purchased litecoins had arrived.The service places dynamic limits on the amount of coins in a given denomination that can be deposited. According to Gonthier, one of the company’s primary goals is to increase liquidity in conjunction with any rise in volume and demand.He told CoinDesk that the service is a reflection of the fundamentals underlying bitcoin itself, saying that the project team wanted something unlike the order book-based systems.Gonthier remarked:When asked about security, Gonthier acknowledged the realities of the exchange landscape and how it remains a primary target for would-be cryptocurrency thieves. A key weakness is that any centralized exchange holds the private keys to customer funds, meaning any event that results in compromised security can result in the loss of coins held.Gonthier said that ShapeShift sidesteps this problem, by minimizing the transaction process to the point where the service never holds any customer funds for longer than needed:Gonthier noted that ShapeShift only stocks its hot wallets with enough coins to meet the demands of an average day of volume, adding that these amounts could grow in the future.Ultimately, ShapeShift hopes to position itself as a viable alternative in the exchange sector for buyers and sellers that don’t want to worry about securing a centralized account.Feedback has been positive thus far, including from figures like litecoin creator Charlie Lee who noted in a published testimonial that he had “been waiting for” this type of solution.Gonthier told CoinDesk that among the company’s flagships products is its API, which he hopes will be used more broadly in the future to enable cross-digital currency acceptance. He said that even big players like BitPay could increase the scope of their services by adding de-facto altcoin support via ShapeShift’s API.Gonthier explained that in this scenario, BitPay's integration of alternative currencies would be virtually seamless, saying:Images via ShapeShift, Shutterstock",2014-10-02
16430,"However, perhaps more crucially, former VeriFone CFO, current Tanjarine president and new BitFury board member Bob Dykes believes that the payments industry is struggling to separate bitcoin from the scores of new payments technologies that have emerged in the last decade.Dykes chooses to view bitcoin and its road to mainstream adoption through this lens, noting that the payments industry has seen the rise and fall of a number of technologies – including QR codes and near-field communication (NFC) – that have promised to bring disruption and change overnight, only to be met with a long road to adoption or a cold shoulder by the industry.As a result, Dykes told CoinDesk, the traditional payments industry is struggling to see how bitcoin will be able to gain wider adoption:Dykes indicated that his ability to recognize this potential lead him to join the team at bitcoin mining services giant BitFury, which raised $20m in May from VC firms like Crypto Currency Partners and angel investor Bill Tai. BitFury manufactures mining hardware and computer chips, and recently completed a 20MW data center in the European country of Georgia.Citing the company's impressive data centre presence and ability to provide low-cost transaction processing through its mining infrastructure, Dykes added:Notably, Dykes suggested that one reason the traditional payments industry has been slow to react to bitcoin is that its businesses see bitcoin as a threat to their cost and profit structures.[post-quote]His former employer VeriFone, for example, earned $436.1m in net revenue during Q1 2014 through products such as multimedia point-of-sale devices, mobile wallets and payment processing, all offerings that bitcoin aims to improve or replace.However, Dykes said that over time, the opinion of his former industry will change because bitcoin will offer new ways for these companies to cut costs and generate revenue through their existing services.Core to this belief is Dykes' assertion that the bitcoin industry is already generating significant revenue, a factor that provides a crucial advantage over past payments technologies:Dykes said that this could prove to be an advantage to bitcoin that helps propel adoption faster than other types of payment technologies.Despite his bullish beliefs about bitcoin's long-term prospects, Dykes suggested that the payment industry isn't likely to embrace bitcoin anytime soon, simply due to its historical resistance to technology.Dykes told CoinDesk:Dykes mentioned cross-border and e-commerce payments as two areas where bitcoin could gain a strong foothold. Elsewhere, he sees the technology becoming more widely used in the background, with established payments giants using bitcoin behind existing services.""You're going to have bitcoin sitting behind a card with a logo on that card, and then [that brand] making a bitcoin wallet and bringing attention to it, so it will create some efficiency in the industry but it's not going to be a major change,"" he explained.Unlike many of his peers, Dykes said that he believes bitcoin has already reached a ""critical mass"" in the market, though he suggested that his definition may be different from other observers.For example, he mentioned bitcoin processors and bitcoin debit card providers that are building on bitcoin's core infrastructure as evidence of this assertion, saying:Still, he cautioned that bitcoin enthusiasts should temper their expectations even in light of his high praise for the industry.Taking a long-term outlook, Dykes concluded:Images via LinkedIn; Shutterstock",2014-10-01
16431,"Attorneys for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Butterfly Labs are allegedly holding talks that could lead to a possible reopening of the troubled bitcoin mining business.The conversation, while still in its early stages, may allow Butterfly Labs to exit its previously announced court-ordered shutdown, The Kansas City Star reported.Butterfly Labs was placed in temporary receivership by a US judge last week, a condition that was extended during a hearing on Monday when prosecutors made the case that both the company and its employees effectively profited at the expense of customers.US District Judge Brian Wimes asked at the time if both sides could potentially agree to what he called a “business plan”. The media outlet suggested that both parties were reportedly enthusiastic about the idea, and discussions have been ongoing since the end of that hearing.Jim Humphrey, an attorney defending Butterfly Labs, said that he was unable to comment at the time but voiced positivity about the future viability of the company.Humphrey told the Star:The discussions follow allegations levied by the federal regulator that Butterfly Labs defrauded customers and failed to deliver mining devices as promised. Further, the action by the agency, which polices anticompetitive or deceptive business practices, follows months of complaints against the company.Documents releasedprior to Monday’s hearing allege that the company used equipment built for customers to mine bitcoins for extended periods prior to shipment.Details about an inaccurate online mining profitability calculator and evidence that Butterfly Labs employees created paraphernalia that mocked customer complaints were also divulged in the documents.At this time, it remains unclear whether Butterfly Labs will reopen completely or partially under court control. Yet, the idea does represent a potential avenue for providing recourse to customers that together lost millions in both investment costs and future profitability as a result of not receiving equipment.There are also questions about if and when customer refunds will be processed. As previously explained by FTC attorney Leah Frazier in an interview with CoinDesk, any refunds that were being issued were frozen as a result of last week's court decision.She remarked at the time:The order extended on Monday continues the asset freeze placed on Butterfly Labs. However, should the company resume operations, there could be provisions put in place mandating that some or all revenue be directed toward customer refunds.Document signing image via Shutterstock",2014-10-01
16432,"A carefully selected group of US Congress members will soon receive bitcoin donations in the mail. For some, it will likely be the first time they come into direct contact with digital currency.Led by a Washington, DC-based political action committee (PAC) focused on bitcoin policy called BitPAC, the initiative will distribute $250 worth of bitcoin in paper wallets to eight members of Congress, including Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Rand Paul (R-KY) and Paul Ryan (R-WI).Additional politicians who will receive the donations include Ron Wyden (D-OR); Ted Cruz (R-TX); Jeb Hensarling (R-TX); Maxine Waters (D-CA); and Jared Polis (D-CO).Speaking to CoinDesk, BitPAC founder Dan Backer said that he expects the initiative to have an impact on Capitol Hill, which he believes must become familiar with decentralized money.In May, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) offered more direction, issuing a report advising that political campaigns and action committees could accept bitcoin donations.Yet, Backer said that the FEC needs to do more:Backer told CoinDesk that the donations are in the mail, and will be delivered sometime this week.BitPAC’s funding comes from an assortment of donors, many whom want to put pressure on US policymakers to make concrete decisions regarding bitcoin and broader campaign finance law.An attorney, Backer represented the Conservative Action Fund as it sought clarity as to whether political campaigns could accept bitcoin for fundraising. The formal request led to a November 2013 FEC hearing that concluded with guidance that bitcoin should be treated as an in-kind donation.Backer believes his BitPAC donations represent a pivotal step toward US politicians realizing the value of bitcoin as a tool for political fundraising, though the process by which this occurs may be unorthodox.Backer told CoinDesk:As such, Backer and his group chose to issue paper bitcoin wallets to the politicians. Paper wallets hold the public and private keys to bitcoin represented on the technology's block chain, or general ledger.Backer told CoinDesk:Backer said that the $250 amount was chosen because it's above the $200.01 threshold reportable by a recipient as an itemized donation.Federal Campaign Finance Lawsread:Given the history of price volatility in bitcoin, $250 measured in today's BTC value provides enough of a cushion to meet that requirement once these donations are reported as in-kind.BitPAC’s aim right now is to focus on clarifying election laws that may relate to bitcoin. This is why the group has targeted both Republicans and Democrats, and members of the government's two legislative bodies, the House of Republicans and US Senate.The donations are meant to entice members of Congress to pressure the FEC, as BitPAC wants the FEC to provide more guidance to solidify the digital currency's use in political fundraising.“Certainly it keeps the issue at the forefront as the FEC considers this,” said Backer.He told CoinDesk that while some of the selected members of Congress have never had to deal with bitcoin, they're unlikely to turn down a campaign donation.Capitol image via Shutterstock",2014-10-01
16433,"The Georgia Institute of Technology has become the first university to integrate bitcoin into its students' dining and shopping experience.Campus payment cards, known as BuzzCards, can now be topped up with the digital currency at the university's BuzzCard Centre, located inside its bookstore.BuzzCards can be used at more than 200 locations on campus, allowing students to pay for meals, parking, recreational facilities and tickets for various sporting events using bitcoin. Georgia Tech also features 10 BuzzCard ATMs where students can withdraw hard cash.Former students and current bitcoin executives Tony Gallippi and Stephen Pair will handle payment processing for the institute via their company BitPay.The university's Bobby Dodd Stadium is another key venue in the rollout. The stadium already sports a bitcoin logo, courtesy of a BitPay partnership with the Georgia Tech Athletic Association announced last July.Now, using any bitcoin wallet, Georgia Tech sports fans can pay for drinks and snacks at two point-of-sale devices in its student area.Students are, however, likely to use Georgia Tech's own ‘Jacket Wallet’ at the checkout. Unveiled last week, the custom implementation of Pheeva's bitcoin wallet is only available to users with a campus email address. As a 'gamified' concept, the wallet rewards users based on how they promote its in-built social network, the COG Cooperative.BitPay executive chairman Tony Gallippi said BitPay was proud to offer an innovative bitcoin payment system to the university and its students.Georgia Tech's athletic director Mike Bobinski said:Bobinski said Georgia Tech is looking forward to working with BitPay to make bitcoin a viable payment option for students and sports fans.Georgia Tech is currently ranked as one of the top 10 public universities in the US, with more than 100 centres focused on interdisciplinary research. More than 21,000 tech-savvy students attend the university and soon they will all have access to bitcoin.In addition, Stephanie Wargo, vice president of marketing at BitPay, revealed the company has ambitions to take the programme further afield:""We see the student market as a huge potential as these millennials are the executives of the future. They have grown up with technology and are quick to embrace new ideas, like bitcoin.""Although Georgia Tech may be the first university to fully integrate bitcoin in its student payment system, a number of campuses are currently experimenting with the currency.The University of Nicosia in Cyprus started accepting bitcoin payments for tuitions and fees last December. It now offers courses on the digital currency along with a number of US universities, including New York University and Duke University.On campuses where the formal university leadership has yet to embrace bitcoin, students groups are looking to start these conversations.For example, earlier this year the MIT Bitcoin Club announced plans to distribute $100 in BTC to each student on campus. Several bitcoin-related apps developed by students were also awarded £15,000 in cash prizes at a MIT Bitcoin Project competition last month.Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.Georgia Tech Tower and Bobby Dodd Stadium images by Eugene Buchko via Shutterstock.",2014-10-01
16434,"UPDATE (1st October 17:00 BST): This article has been updated with comment from Ronan Lynch, a co-owner of the ATM previously installed at The Baggot Inn.Dublin’s first bitcoin pub has removed its bitcoin ATM and stopped accepting payments in the digital currency, citing legal issues.Earlier this year, The Baggot Inn became the first pub in Ireland's capital to accept bitcoin, announcing its first transaction via Twitter back in March.Dublin & Ireland's first pint of Guinness paid in Bitcoin! @Baggot_Inn #bitcoinireland #bitcoin @rogerkver pic.twitter.com/XfTowcXpkG— The Baggot Inn (@Baggot_Inn) March 4, 2014The pub's Robocoin bitcoin ATM arrived later that month. However, according to the machine's co-owner Ronan Lynch it was removed following a change in management.Although The Baggot Inn's previous owners were keen to install the machine and accept bitcoin payments, its new owners do not want to be associated with the digital currency, he said.The Baggot Inn issued a statement explaining its decision to suspend its bitcoin services:However, Lynch was keen to dismiss this. ""There is no legal issue or question surrounding Bitcoin in Ireland. In fact, Arthur Cox, the most prominent law firm in Ireland, published a report on the matter over the summer,” he told CoinDesk.CoinDesk contacted the venue for further comment but no response had been received at press time. The bitcoin section of the pub’s website is still live, but the main page states: “Unfortunately we can no longer accept bitcoin payments.”Although other establishments in Ireland have started accepting bitcoin, as far as active ATMs go, the country is now down to one – a Skyhook machine operated by BitEx.ie, installed at computing retailer GSM Solutions on Abbey Street, Dublin.Lynch said he is still looking for a new location for his Robocoin machine.New Zealand’s Bitcoin Central was forced to shut its doors late July, after local banks refused to provide financial services to the company. Bitcoin Central had launched its first Robocoin ATM just a month prior on 3rd June.A planned rollout of Robocoin machines in Taiwan was derailed after the local regulator said it would block the installation of bitcoin ATMs.Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) cited a joint statement it made in partnership with the country’s central bank, which stated that bitcoin is not a currency and that no bank deposits are allowed in bitcoin.Installing a bitcoin ATM would require FSC approval and the regulator made it clear that approval would not be granted.",2014-10-01
