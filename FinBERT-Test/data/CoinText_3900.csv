3801,"Coinbase will list Tether's USDT on its professional trading platform, allowing investors to deposit the dollar-pegged stablecoin immediately and to begin trading next week.Coinbase Pro announced late Thursday it would immediately allow ""inbound transfers"" for USDT in its supported jurisdictions, except for the U.S. state of New York. The stablecoin has been fraught with controversy over questions of its backing and its role in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, and at one point was the subject of an inquiry by the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG).The NYAG settled the inquiry this year, stating that at previous points USDT was not fully backed by U.S. dollars but declined to bring any enforcement or regulatory action. Under the terms of the settlement, Tether will provide a periodic report to the NYAG indicating how the stablecoin is backed and what its reserves look like, starting in May.Tether has since announced it would provide regular attestations, though these are different from the reports it will send to the NYAG and similar attestations from stablecoin issuers including Centre, Paxos and Gemini.USDT is listed on the U.S.-based Kraken and Binance.US exchanges, but Coinbase is subject to closer regulatory scrutiny, having gone public last week on the U.S. Nasdaq exchange. The public listing subjects Coinbase to oversight by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could include its token listings.As such, Coinbase's move Thursday could be read as a vindication of sorts for Tether, long criticized as less-than-forthright about the composition of the reserves backing USDT.""Starting immediately, we will begin accepting inbound transfers of USDT to Coinbase Pro. Trading will begin on or after 6 p.m. Pacific Time (PT) Monday April 26, if liquidity conditions are met. Please note that Coinbase only supports ERC-20 USDT,"" the announcement said.The exchange will begin supporting trading against its order books after it has sufficient supply, with trading commencing in its usual post-only, limit-only and full trading phases.""If at any point one of the new order books does not meet our assessment for a healthy and orderly market, we may keep the book in one state for a longer period of time or suspend trading as per our Trading Rules,"" the blog post said.While Coinbase Pro listed USDT, it's unclear if or when the token will come to its consumer application. Typically, tokens listed on the professional platform are added to the retail side within a few days.The move also follows a tough week for bitcoin, which has fallen 18% since Saturday. For the year to date, however, the bellwether cryptocurrency is still up a fulsome 75%. As the largest stablecoin, USDT serves as integral plumbing for the $2 trillion global cryptocurrency market, allowing traders to easily shift dollars (or a good-enough substitute) between exchanges in order to capture arbitrage opportunities.

3802,"Jackson, Tenn., is the latest U.S. city to embrace the potential of bitcoin, according to its mayor, Scott Conger.“What does the future of cryptocurrency look like for the city of Jackson? We’re exploring payroll conversions for our employees. Even more exciting, we’re seriously exploring mining bitcoin to add to our balance sheet,” Conger tweeted.Jackson ""is in a prime position to be a leader in bitcoin adoption, especially for cities our size,"" Conger told CoinDesk via email. ""We are currently exploring opportunities for our employees to diversify their deferred compensation by adding a bitcoin conversion option. That will allow our employees to utilize dollar cost averaging to increase and enhance their portfolios. “We are also looking into the cost of mining bitcoin to add to our balance sheet.."" Conger, who was elected mayor in June 2019 and is the third member of his family to hold the position after his grandfather and great-great-great-grandfather, has been busy in recent weeks tweeting about cryptocurrency and the city’s moves toward adopting it. On Monday, he added the laser eyes popular among bitcoin enthusiasts to his Twitter profile picture. Earlier this month he announced a blockchain task force for the city and tagged the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, another crypto advocate mayor.On Wednesday, the mayor tweeted that local governments “will lead the way” in adopting bitcoin and “usher in a new industrial revolution with sustainable economies that will help close the wealth gap.”Jackson, population nearly 70,000, based on recent U.S. Census data, is following the example of Miami, according to Conger. Mayor Suarez has said he envisions his city becoming a bitcoin mining hub. In an interview with CoinDesk in February, Suarez sees Miami as “a trend‑setting city at the forefront of crypto and blockchain technology,” including enabling municipal employees to receive portions of their salaries in bitcoin and residents to use cryptocurrencies for “payments and fees” – taxes among them. (In 2018, Ohio became the first U.S. state to permit taxes to be paid in bitcoin.)“I think it’s easy to find the 14,000,604 ways something won’t work,” Conger told CoinDesk, in a seeming reference to Doctor Strange and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “Leaders have to find the way it will work. We can hold on to the way it’s always been done, or we can drive innovation. We have to be willing to embrace the future and create a vision on how to get there.”",2021-04-22
3803,"Bitcoin's price extended its recent decline late Thursday, falling for the seventh day in nine, to as low as $50,450. The largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $51,800 as of 21:23 coordinated universal time (5:23 p.m. ET). Bitcoin (BTC) is down 9.8% since Sunday, the biggest drop on the weekly price charts since late February. A recent rally in prices for ether (ETH) and other alternative cryptocurrencies has coincided with a stalling out in bitcoin's rally this year. Earlier Thursday, bitcoin's so-called dominance ratio – its market capitalization as a share of that for all cryptocurrencies – slipped below 50% for the first time since 2018.  Bitcoin also has broken below its 50-day moving price average on the daily chart, seen as a sign of slowing momentum. Pankaj Balani, CEO of crypto derivatives venue Delta Exchange, told CoinDesk earlier Thursday the outlook was starting to look bearish for bitcoin. “BTC has slipped below the 50-day moving average support that it held sacrosanct through this rally, and looks like there is more downside here,” Balani said. ",2021-04-22
3804,"Craig Wright, chief scientist at nChain, has won a minor procedural legal victory in support of his quest to claim control of the rights to the white paper that laid the groundwork for the bitcoin cryptocurrency. According to a Reuters report, London's High Court will allow Wright to serve a copyright lawsuit against the publisher of bitcoin.org, who goes by the pseudonym Cobra. The thrust of the order allows Wright to serve the lawsuit via a generic email, or Twitter, given Cobra is not an acknowledged U.K. resident. Cobra has “not disclosed a name, identity or address, according to court filings issued on Wednesday,” Reuters states.  The move is largely procedural and does not settle any questions around the origin of the Bitcoin white paper, which is the subject of the claim and which Wright claims to have written. Wright’s long list of litigationsThe court's decisions is the most recent development in a legal battle that has stretched out for years. In particular, this lawsuit stems from Wright's widely disputed claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, author of the Bitcoin white paper, the groundbreaking document that laid the groundwork for what is now the world's leading cryptocurrency. According to Wright's reasoning, because he is Nakamoto, no other entity is authorized to host the paper. The ethos is at odds with the open-source and decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Wright sent out a rash of cease and desist letters to Bitcoin Core developers, for example, over their hosting of the white paper. In response, the paper was initially taken down by bitcoin.org, given how the legal case would involve time, money and energy, commodities the group said it didn't want to waste on a lawsuit.Soon after, multiple companies and organizations decided to host the Bitcoin white paper in solidarity. These included Square Crypto, crypto venture fund Paradigm, policy think-tank Coin Center and Facebook stablecoin subsidiary Novi, among others.In response to a cease and desist order sent to Square, the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) filed a lawsuit against Wright in the U.K. over his copyright claims. The Alliance was formed in September 2020 and founded by Square to pool patents and preserve the industry’s open-source spirit.The ramifications, including those from this lawsuit, should force Wright to provide conclusive proof that he is Nakamoto, something he has failed to do thus far. ",2021-04-22
3805,"The market is clearly choosing other digital assets over bitcoin. Ether hits a fresh record price and BNB dominates.Bitcoin had its fourth day of weak market action. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency was seeing some selling action as of press time, causing the price to dip to $52,612. Pankaj Balani, CEO of crypto derivatives venue Delta Exchange, notes that when looking at a larger trading chart time frame the outlook is starting to look bearish for bitcoin. “BTC has slipped below the 50-day moving average support that it held sacrosanct through this rally, and looks like there is more downside here,” Balani told CoinDesk. As a result of last weekend’s bitcoin dump, BTC’s spot price is now below its 50-day moving average, the first time that has occurred since October 2020, according to the daily charts from TradingView.“We might see a sharp bounce in bitcoin, but until it moves above $60,000 the possibility of a bull trap cannot be eliminated,” Balani added. Perhaps one benefit of this drop in price, at least from a store-of-value perspective many bitcoin proponents advocate, is that BTC volatility continues a slow decline. Bitcoin’s 30-day annualized volatility, as measured by CoinDesk Research, was at 48.9% on April 21, a long slow fall from 2021’s high of 112.8% 30-day volatility on Feb. 9.As a result, traders are clearly focused on other blockchain-based assets in the crypto ecosystem, Delta Exchange’s Balani said. “We are seeing strong signs in [altcoins]; ether is the focus here.”Read More: Ripple’s Chris Larsen Says Bitcoin Should Move Away From Proof-of-WorkEther (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday, trading around $2,515 and climbing 3.7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). After last weekend’s crypto crash, when the market experienced a record-high $10 billion in liquidations on the derivatives market – the crypto equivalent of a margin call that pushed the crypto market downward – ether’s price performance has been going like gangbusters. The record high for ether’s price is now $2,645.14, according to CoinDesk 20 data, and that was achieved Thursday. Since the past weekend's dump, when ETH was at a low of $2,067, according to CoinDesk 20 data, the price has jumped 21% at press time. Over the same time period bitcoin has fallen 2%. Joel Kruger, a cryptocurrency strategist at the LMAX Digital exchange, says market actors are likely getting more sophisticated about investing in assets other than bitcoin, leading to strong ETH buying. “As traditional market participants familiarize themselves with the space, they are slowly discovering the value proposition that extends beyond bitcoin,” Kruger told CoinDesk. Gary Pike, director of sales and trading at crypto liquidity provider B2C2, says attention paid to Coinbase’s direct listing and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have many people researching blockchain outside of bitcoin and pouring money into these nascent technologies. “NFTs and the Coinbase [listing] have brought more people into the ecosystem that previously hadn't participated, even though they knew about bitcoin,” Pike said. Read More: Ether Price Hits New Record High as Analysts Anticipate Supply DropBitcoin’s price has remained in stasis this week and its dominance slid below 50% for the first time since 2018. Meanwhile, alternative cryptocurrencies such as crypto exchange Binance’s BNB token are making major market share gains. Crypto dominance is a measure of its market share as a percentage of the larger ecosystem of digital assets. Since the start of 2021, BNB, which can be used on Binance to pay for trading fees, has appreciated from 0.71% market dominance on Jan. 1, 2021, to 4.1% as of press time, a fivefold increase. Sean Rooney, head of research for Valkyrie Investments, says BNB’s rise in dominance signals further development of decentralized finance, or DeFi. “BNB is able to benefit from an explosive DeFi sector,” he told CoinDesk. BNB operates on Binance Chain, a blockchain developer platform that is a much smaller rival to Ethereum. Rooney noted that “ETH also benefits from this as well” because the rise in BNB’s dominance brings in new users interested in the programmable money aspects of these platforms.

3806,"This Earth Day, I propose a simple solution to bitcoin’s massive ecological footprint: Bitcoiners should go vegan en masse. (Relax, it's satire.)Bitcoin isn’t switching to proof-of-stake. (Sorry, New York Times.) And a pathway towards a fully sustainable mining ecosystem is anything but clear. (Sorry, Ripple, CoinShares and ConsenSys.) But there is one thing you can change: your diet.Proof-of-work mining is a powerful cryptographic technique that’s necessary for the Bitcoin system to achieve its ends of providing a free and open alternative monetary base. Without it, Bitcoin would lose its strong finality and decentralization, meaning transactions are more likely to be rolled back. It burns energy (a lot of energy) to create a peculiar type of trust.In doing away with centralized parties in money, Bitcoin has generated a new class of individuals willing to question hierarchies everywhere they are encountered. The most ardent supporters think from first principles, embrace anarchy and distrust any received wisdom. This attitude can have peculiar effects, including the rise of highly restrictive, carnivorous diets, thought to be closer to the ideal state of nature.“To get to a place where you are interested in Bitcoin, you have to sort of go against the grain and come to your own conclusions,” Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications at Coin Center and budding food influencer, said in a phone call. “If you don't trust established dogma on money, then you wouldn’t on nutrition.”It’s easy to dismiss crypto carnivory as little more than a meme – it’s certainly an ironic position for some – but there are true believers. Many of the most vocal Bitcoin advocates can also be heard championing diets rich in animal protein.See also: Everything We Want Costs Energy, Including BitcoinThere’s Saifedean Ammous and Pierre Rochard, who hold court over steak-and-bitcoin dinners. There’s Nic Carter, whose 10 rules for life include “eat meat” and “reject seed oil.” Some, like legendary coder Zooko Wilcox, have long embraced a carnivorous ketogenic diet, seemingly before Bitcoin was around.The list goes on.Just as Bitcoin is highly energy intensive, so, too, is modern industrial production of edible flesh. And if you scratch the surface, there’s way less justification for it. Bitcoin provides a public good in the form of an uncensorable, pseudo-anonymous digital currency. Factory farming provides a cheap source of energy-dense food. A chicken in every pot!However, ""intensive animal farming,"" the industry’s term, has also led to some of the world’s highest carbon and methane emissions, poisoned rivers, the collapse of the family farm, widespread animal cruelty and abuse, exploited workers, cancerous meals, lagoons of feces, clouds of stink and the conditions that could lead to next global pandemic. (Sorry, COVID-19.)It’s for those reasons, and more, that billionaire crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried has gone vegan.“You can think of it from a utilitarian perspective,” Bankman-Fried said over Zoom. It divides down to a lifetime of abuse of sentient creatures for a single pleasant meal. “Factory farming is a source of suffering in the world and a man‑made one.” There’s a genuine debate whether animals suffer the way humans do. It’s a subject too large to tackle here, though there are plenty of reasons to assume that many animals (especially mammals) have cognition and complicated emotions.See also: Anonymous Dogecoin Donor Pays Adoption Fees at Florida Dog ShelterEven if you take the line that animals are nothing but machines for people to use, there’s an ideologically aligned reason bitcoiners should go meatless: It’s an industry propped up by debt financing.Some bitcoiners like to argue that modern carbo-rich diets are an expression of the “fiat mindset,” that the over-abundance of corn sugars and other “body pollutants” stem from government intervention in the food chain, but that’s also the case for the majority of what hangs in your butcher’s window.Agrawal, who thinks bitcoiners should eat as they please, personally avoids “industrially produced” meat. He spends the extra money to buy the nice, organic, locally or family farmed choice cuts, in bulk, to practice the art of at-home butchery. “It brings you a little bit closer to the source of your food,” he said.I often do the same. But that’s not a solution available to everyone. And frankly, it’s a lifestyle that’s hard to maintain even for those who can afford it. But it’s also missing the point.If bitcoiners are committed to combating climate change, what better way to show it than a declaration to sacrifice meat to protect their sacred cow. It’s a public show of defiance, which they love, and a more believable form of industry activism than pretending mining can be wholly and reliably powered with solar or wind energy.See also: CoinDesk Research – Does Bitcoin Have an Energy Problem?To be sure, Agrawal thinks the idea that bitcoiners “need to atone for using electricity to run data centers” is wrong on the surface. Further, practically, “It’s not going to change anyone's mind.”All I can say is, if Bitcoin opened your mind, let it also open your heart. ",2021-04-22
3807,"Bitcoin's recent price drawdowns – the percentage decline from peak to trough – shouldn’t come as a surprise for cryptocurrency traders used to volatility. But it could present opportunities to buy the dip, according to a new report by Stack Funds, a Singapore based digital asset investment firm.The near 15% decline in the bitcoin price (BTC) earlier this week is on a par with previous drawdowns that took roughly five to 10 days to recover. “Drawdowns happen all the time, and crypto markets are no different from traditional markets,” wrote Stack Funds.According to Ecoinometrics, a cryptocurrency newsletter, the market dynamics are consistent with what might be expected in the year after a ""halving"" on the Bitcoin blockchain. A halving is when the blockchain automatically cuts the rate of issuance of new bitcoins by 50%, and it happens every four years. The last one was in May 2020.    “Right now, we are in another one of those drawdowns that commonly happens during a post-halving bull market: 20% drawdowns, five days, nothing special,” Ecoinometrics, wrote Wednesday. “Honestly, the current price action does not look like a bull market top for bitcoin.”",2021-04-22
3808,"The near 15% sell-off in bitcoin (BTC) on April 17 marked a quick sentiment shift from “absolute euphoria to agonizing panic,” based on an analysis by Arcane Research of the cryptocurrency's derivative-funding rates.In the past few days, the cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in the cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets, declined into negative territory, which typically precede spot price recoveries. The funding rate period is eight hours and is averaged across exchanges, weighted by the open interest, according to Glassnode. ",2021-04-22
3809,"Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, or the ratio of the largest cryptocurrency's value to the overall market capitalization of digital assets, slipped below 50% for the first time since 2018, according to the data sites CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.The ratio was 48% as of 15:44 coordinated universal time (11:44 a.m. ET) and came as ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-largest overall, surged to a new all-time high. Bitcoin's market value is about $1.02 trillion, versus about $2.13 trillion for CoinGecko's universe of 6,816 digital coins. Ether's share of the market capitalization is about 14%.Although 12-year-old bitcoin is up 88% this year, reaching an all-time high just below $65,000 earlier in April, the rally has stalled recently, and the price has since faded to about $55,000. Instead, traders have bid up prices for other cryptocurrencies, from Aave's AAVE tokens (+347% year to date) to Zcash's ZEC (+330%). That's in addition to the well-documented rallies in ether, up 256%, and dogecoin (DOGE), which has climbed 50-fold in 2021. The rapid price increases are drawing comparisons to the rampant speculation that took place during cryptocurrencies' last big bull run in 2017 and early 2018, punctuated by a spate of so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs, many of which gave way to steep losses later in 2018.""It’s a signal the market is risk-on and 'alts' are outperforming,"" David Grider, an analyst at FundStrat, told CoinDesk in an email.

3810,"The CEO of Turkish crypto exchange Thodex has gone missing at a time when users filed a complaint alleging hundreds of million of dollars have been stolen.Mehmet, 34, noticed Wednesday the Turkish cryptocurrency exchange Thodex was no longer accessible; an error message was flashing across his screen. Panicking, he tried to access Thodex’s main website and found a troubling message: Thodex had halted all transactions in order to evaluate an unspecified partnership offer. The process would take about four to five business days, it continued, adding that users would be regularly updated. Before shutting down transactions, Thodex was trading more than $585 million in cryptocurrencies on its exchange, according to data from CoinMarketCap. A spokesperson for the data site told CoinDesk the exchange stopped providing trading data around 17:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET) on April 20.The exchange also had about 400,000 users, 390,000 of whom were trading actively, according to state news agency Anadolu.While Thodex’s website said it would be back up shortly, exchange executives are deactivating their social media profiles and the platform’s customer support group is inaccessible. The exchange's website said “there is no cause for concern” and that “negative news on the internet” is not true. Meanwhile, Thodex founder and CEO Faruk Fatih Özer shut down his Twitter account on Wednesday. Mehmet alerted the police of the exchange’s sudden closure, telling CoinDesk that being shut out of highly volatile crypto markets for five days could spell disaster for investors.  “Average people invest in crypto in Turkey because they would like to hedge their little funds against inflation here. So people will lose a lot of money, me included, and I had to do something about it,” Mehmet told CoinDesk. At the same time, according to state news service Anadolu Agency, a lawyer named Abdullah Usame Ceran has filed a criminal complaint against Ozer alleging “aggravated fraud.”Oğuz Evren Kılıç, chairman of the Ankara Bar Association’s Capital Markets and Finance Law Commission, told CoinDesk via a written statement that he’d learned through local police that Özer had left the country Tuesday night. Özer also did not respond to attempts by Bloomberg to contact him Wednesday morning. The Istanbul Anatolian Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office has launched an investigation into Thodex for “fraud” and “establishing a criminal organization,” according to CNN Turk. A day later the exchange refuted charges of fraud in an updated statement on its website. The same statement was shared to a new Twitter account attributed to Ozer.People in Turkey have increasingly been turning to crypto as a hedge against inflation. Inflation in the country has been on the rise this year, reaching as high as 16% in March thanks to a spike in oil prices and the recent volatility of the local lira, according to Bloomberg. Although the crypto space was unregulated in the country, earlier this month, the central bank announced that the republic was banning the use of cryptocurrencies for payments. Crypto trading remains unaffected by the new law, which is set to go into effect at the end of the month. So Thodex’s sudden disappearance appears to be an isolated incident. “There may be a scam here because there have been problems with this exchange for days,” Kılıç said.  Mehmet first thought something wasn’t right with Thodex when he saw certain cryptocurrencies – including dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that was created as a joke in 2013 – were trading on the exchange for much lower prices than on other markets on the night before the exchange shut down. In fact, on April 17, one Twitter user pointed out that dogecoin was selling on Thodex up to 30% below the market price. This was at a time when, a few days later, dogecoin’s price briefly replaced digital asset XRP as the fourth-largest coin by global market capitalization on Monday.  On April 19, the exchange announced it was carrying out a short-term maintenance on dogecoin transactions.  Right before the exchange went offline, dogecoin accounted for more than 53% of Thodex’s $585 million trading volume, compared to a measly $10 million in bitcoin. “This exchange has been experiencing a great deal of traffic over dogecoin for a few days. Tens of thousands of customers flocked to the website of this exchange. In fact, even this price imbalance was suspicious,” Kılıç said. According to the message posted on the Thodex website, transactions have been put on hold while the exchange considers a potential partnership with undisclosed parties. “World-renowned banks and fund companies, whose name we will announce when the agreement process is completed, have been wanting to invest in our company for a long time and have made a partnership proposal. In order to serve you better, it has been decided to evaluate the partnership offer positively. In order for this process to be completed, the transactions must be stopped and the transfer process must be completed,” the statement said in Turkish. Ismail Hakki Polat, a blockchain lecturer at the Kadir Has University in Istanbul, said that based on the statement made by the company, the only possible conclusion he could come up with was that Thodex’s shareholder structure will be changed with the new investors.  “Before that, all views can be regarded as speculative comments that will panic the crypto investors and jeopardize the local ecosystem,” Polat said. Thodex claims to be the “first licensed Turkish Company in the sector globally” with a license “received from the United States of America,"" according to its statement. The firm is referring to its registration as a Money Service Business (MSB) with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or FinCEN. However, the registration of a business on the MSB Registrant Search Web page is neither a recommendation, a certification of legitimacy, or an endorsement of the business by any U.S. government agency. It is also not a license. Crypto exchanges can operate in the U.S. by securing money transmitter licenses through state government entities. A FinCEN registration does not on its own permit exchanges to commence trading operations. Meanwhile, Kılıç, who has been offering legal advice to those affected by Thodex’s sudden suspension of operations, says customers have not been able to reach the exchange officials, and no customer has been able to withdraw their money or crypto so far. Mehmet remains hopeful the exchange's closure is temporary. “Apparently, the guys are not running away and this is not a scam or anything. I think what they've done is they’ve damaged themselves and also their customers,” Mehmet said. On Thursday, the Thodex website updated the statement on display, claiming the allegations against the exchange by users and the media were unfounded. A new Twitter account, claiming to be Özer's shared the statement. It appears Özer himself wrote the message, which goes on to say that during partnership negotiations an abnormality was found in the company accounts. Specifically, the message states 30,000 user accounts (out of some 700,000) were found to be suspicious, and are being cleared. “Thodex Platform has been temporarily closed to determine the reasons and sources of this. While our technical team of our company was conducting this research, I personally went abroad on 19.04.2021 to make final meetings with foreign investors,” the message said in Turkish. Özer added that as a result of the “smear campaign” against him and his company, it has become difficult to continue its “commercial life.”“In this way; I kindly submit to the public's knowledge that the smear campaign against both myself and my company should not be respected,” Özer said.Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that a senior official in Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s office called for the rapid regulation of the crypto space. Bloomberg also reported that the Turkish government had moved to block Thodex’s accounts and police had raided its head office in Istanbul.UPDATE (Apr. 22, 2021, 14:17 UTC):  The article has been updated to include a new statement released by Thodex CEO Faruk Fatih Özer.UPDATE (Apr. 23, 2021, 01:08 UTC): The article has been modified to include a new update on government action via Bloomberg.",2021-04-22

That’s the lowest in almost a month, according to data aggregator Glassnode.That means market interest in bull-oriented leveraged plays has evaporated. The lowest in the past month was 5 basis points March 26. Traders are waiting to see if the figure will get to that point. Neil Van Huis, head of institutional trading for liquidity provider Blockfills, says last week’s excitement from the bellwether exchange Coinbase’s Nasdaq direct listing has subsided. He worries about downside risk, despite holding on to his bullish stance. “Still looks bullish to me – breaking $38,000 or so would make me a bit more nervous,” Van Huis told CoinDesk.Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Tuesday, trading around $2,313 and climbing 6.3% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). Read More: Introducing CoinDesk IndexesDarius Sit, chief investment officer for quantitative trading firm QCP Capital, doesn’t see any fundamental reasons why ether's performance was much higher on Tuesday when bitcoin traded relatively sideways. “Don’t see anything material,” he told CoinDesk.It is clear, however, that traders are rotating out of other crypto assets and into ETH. Ether’s market dominance Tuesday, a measure of its share of the larger crypto ecosystem, was up 3.6% today as of press time and at 13.1% overall according to charting provider TradingView.After jumping over 19% Monday, the canine-oriented meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) was in the red 16.2% as of press time, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Enthusiasts were expected to rally the price Tuesday for “Dogeday”. However, dogecoin’s cryptocurrency’s volatility is more of a story than its price Tuesday, according to Greg Magadini, CEO of derivatives data provider Genesis Volatility.Magadini’s firm, which tracks volatility metrics for 90 different altercoin’s, pegs dogecoin as the third-highest volatile digital asset it tracks on Tuesday, trailing only ziliqua (ZIL) and voyager token (VGX).However, dogecoin is significantly more liquid than those two assets, Magadini noted, meaning there are a lot more traders and investors betting on DOGE’s spot price. “The difference with dogecoin and these other [altcoins] is DOGE actually has a sizable market cap, so this volatility is much more significant,” Magadini told CoinDesk. Dogecoin’s market capitalization ranks sixth overall among cryptocurrencies at around $46 billion, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. ZIL and VGX combined only make up about $3 billion. “Right now, the way DOGE is moving risk is greatly increasing,” Magadini said. Read More: Buying Dogecoin on 4/20? 3 Things You Need to ConsiderDigital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly red Monday.

3815,"Some fans of the joke cryptocurrency dogecoin had positioned Tuesday as a day to send its prices skyrocketing – to $1, or maybe just a meme-y 69 cents. On the meme-y date of April 20, or 4/20.  Prices for the eight-year-old cryptocurrency, ticker DOGE, had surged more than 60-fold this year to a market value of more than $40 billion. So it seemed like anything was possible. Social media posters dubbed it ""dogeday.""But as of midafternoon, the joke appeared to be on the dogecoin holders. As of press time, the token, symbolized by the Shiba Inu dog breed, was down 21% on the day, to the decidedly unremarkable price of 34 cents. Earlier it had fallen to as low as 29 cents.""Many retail crypto traders were hoping for today to be a successful 'Dogeday' by sending dogecoin to the moon,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the brokerage Oanda. ""Some were eyeing the $0.50 level as an area to take some profit, with others having outlandish hopes of a skyrocketing move to the $1 mark. The current retail fervor probably won’t completely give up on dogecoin, but a sell-the-event reaction could be in the cards.""The DOGE dump came even as at least one analyst, Bloomberg Intelligence's Mike McGlone, wrote that the cryptocurrency might be due for further gains. “Gaining somewhat of a global cult following, we see little to stop DOGE from continuing to appreciate, at least in the near term,” McGlone, a commodity strategist known for his prescient bitcoin price predictions last year, wrote Tuesday in a report. ""Dogecoin may be casino-like fun."" It was a shot of water in the face for DOGE fans who may have instead been looking for a treat – in the form of fast profits or instant fortunes. A remaining question is whether this year's gains in dogecoin might draw fresh capital and labor to the  project, similar to the way last year's pump in GameStop shares led to a $1 billion capital raise, a search for new management and potentially a transition to an e-commerce strategy. At one point, dogecoin had a market value bigger than the centuries-old U.K. bank Barclays. Blockchain data shows that activity is increasing on the network: Active Dogecoin addresses have climbed to record, and transactions are at a seven-year high, according to the analytics firm Coin Metrics. CoinDesk reported earlier this year that project development on the blockchain has picked up, with top contributions from Bitcoin Core developers, based on activity on the open-source software site GitHub.    Within broader digital-asset markets, the DOGE frenzy appeared to spread to decentralized finance (DeFi), where several imitator tokens have chalked up staggering single-day gains.The first is SHIB (get it? Shiba Inu?), a decentralized experimental token nicknamed the ""dogecoin killer,"" trading on the decentralized exchange Uniswap. The token, launched under the Ethereum blockchain's ERC-20 standard, has rallied over 5,000% in the past four weeks and rose 95% on Monday alongside DOGE's rally to record highs near 43 cents. The coin has registered a trading volume of over $200 million in the past 24 hours, Uniswap data shows.Another coin, weed doge (WOGE), launched this week, allegedly in a bid to donate funds to people considered unjustly jailed for marijuana-related offenses. WOGE rallied 1,058% from to $0.0950 on Monday though was last seen trading near $0.0170 on Uniswap. ""Since DOGE has been taking care of us and providing us with godly profits this bull run, we also wanted to create a meaningful coin that gives back to the people in a handful of ways,"" says a post on CryptoMoonShots Reddit page. Most of this ridiculousness is seen as evidence of froth in cryptocurrency markets, at a time when bitcoin prices have doubled this year – ostensibly as a hedge against inflation, in the wake of trillions of dollars of money printing by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.     Bloomberg's McGlone noted that dogecoin had demonstrated ""divergent strength"" as bitcoin's price has retreated in recent days. The report was published prior to Tuesday's losses in dogecoin. But sometimes, apparently, the DOGE doesn't come when called. ",2021-04-20
3816,"In many aspects of life, we have a tendency to assume a zero–sum approach to decision-making. What is good for one side is decidedly and proportionately disadvantageous for the other: Heads I win, tails you lose. You are either a dog or cat person, a skier or a snowboarder, prefer the aisle or window seat. But nothing is one dimensional in today’s complex and multi-faceted investment universe. The vast majority of decisions are actually non-zero-sum, especially if we consider the trillions upon trillions that comprise the global capital markets. When it comes to cryptocurrencies and gold, the popular narrative is that the former is stealing the latter’s thunder – crypto's gains are gold’s losses. Again, the impulse to distill it down to an either/or scenario comes with a very costly lesson, your money. The prudent asset mix considers the maximum return for the lowest level of volatility. As in the case of gold and crypto, each fulfils a complementary function as a repository of value in a global context of uncertainty and looming inflation.  The gold market is estimated at over $11 trillion, which reflects a 2,500-year head start as a globally recognized medium of exchange and value. By contrast, bitcoin has a market cap of about $1 trillion. Even the amount of physical gold held by central banks and investors equates to many times bitcoin’s current market. In 2020, gold’s average daily volume was $125 billion, or roughly 30 times bitcoin’s daily spot volume of some $4 billion. Notwithstanding, both assets have highly liquid markets, meaning there is undeniably ample space for both crypto and gold to flourish.So, rather than view crypto and gold as competitors, an acceptable analogy might be to consider crypto as the legitimate offspring, or spinoff, with certain common markers. They both have low correlation to other families of assets, and they are inflation–sensitive, great diversifiers and alternatives to fiat issues. Gold is a reliable, age-old secure store of value, and the other a new generation that is growing and evolving, quick to react but lacking the wisdom of longevity.  While investors in the U.S. are jumping onto the crypto bandwagon – which might create the impression that gold is passé – elsewhere in the world, people long accustomed to buying gold are only now open to considering crypto. Investors should be cautious that investing in crypto at the wrong time can result in rapid and severe losses. Anything that can appreciate unimaginably quickly may be prone to severe corrections. Nothing is guaranteed. While crypto is embraced in North America and some other countries, it is practically banned in China and frowned upon in South Korea.  As a believer in both gold and crypto (particularly DeFi), I can envision gold’s reinstatement in North American portfolios at $2,200 highs. That doesn’t preclude investors from diversifying into other asset classes such as crypto. There are already signs of inflation, much more so than the feds would have you believe, and as governments continue to print money, it will continue its upward trajectory. That means the price of gold, bitcoin, ethereum and critically decentralized finance (DeFi) will all benefit. The view held by Peter Schiff, a former chief economist and strategist of Euro Pacific Capital, that cryptocurrencies are not money and that investments in them are foolhardy, is flawed in my opinion. Inarguably, the value of anything lies in what one is willing to pay for it. The fate of any currency, digital or otherwise, is in the hands of the financial institutions and credit card companies that actualize its relevance. As DeFi protocols grow, built off the back of Ethereum and Bitcoin, you simply can't argue that these digital entities have no value. Crypto’s value, driven by DeFi alone, could make it worth the value of all the traditional financial markets.  The psychology of investing has shown that reasonable and rational behavior almost never coincide. One might think that a bitcoin necklace is worthless, when in reality, it’s not. There are very astute institutional investors and savvy legendary macro investors who believe that crypto is the future because it’s creating a crypto-economy that can run without government–based monopolies that exist now. Think of it as Facebook 2.0 or Email 2.0 – back in the mid-1990s, email (and certainly Facebook) barely existed. Email was a burgeoning novelty appreciated by few; no one expected to use email as legal tender, or was convinced the internet was safe. Yet look at where we are today. Things change before we know it, which lends credence to the notion that cryptocurrencies and destabilizing DeFi protocols are here to stay. The benefits of crypto, DeFi and blockchain technology are immense – whether it’s Know Your Client (KYC), the elimination of terrorist financing, or eliminating proceeds of crime – cannot be underestimated. These protocols are significant advantages over gold, which can be made untraceable. Some still think the Nazi gold hordes reside in gold vaults all over the world – no one can argue these are not direct proceeds of terrorism. If we foresee a place for gold and crypto in the future, over time I expect they will couple and correlate. That’s if the past is any indication. If bitcoin can conceivably reach $80,000–$100,000, and gold $3,500–$5,000 in the near to medium term, people will be likely to invest in both. And the DeFi protocols that grow off the Ethereum/Bitcoin and other blockchains may be worth hundreds of thousands of multiples more.No, crypto is not likely to replace gold. They are two sides of a coin, the patriarch and progeny, each in a position to benefit from the other’s experience and perspective.",2021-04-20
3817,"Tether (USDT), the oldest and most popular stablecoin, diverged significantly from its peg to the U.S. dollar during bitcoin's (BTC) recent price drop.But rather than seeing the move as a defect of the stablecoin, whose market cap stands at $52 billion, some analysts and exchange executives say the ""tether premium"" shows the token's growing use as a safe-haven asset in almost-anything-can-happen-at-anytime cryptocurrency markets.    ""During a crash, traders will race to sell their bitcoin in exchange for tether, which is similar to the U.S. dollar in that it is recognized as a temporary safe haven amidst extreme price volatility,"" Kaiko, a blockchain data analytics firm, wrote in an April 19 newsletter. ""A sudden increase in buying pressure for tether often has the effect of causing positive drift from the stablecoin's one-to-one peg.""The idea of tether as a safe haven might seem incongruous, given the nagging questions over the stablecoin issuer's credibility and financial backing. The company behind the stablecoin published an attestation in late March to verify its assets, after agreeing to an $18.5 million settlement with prosecutors in New York state. Yet tether's market value has more than doubled from about $20 billion at the start of the year, a sign of traders' growing embrace of the stablecoin's convenience and efficiency as the de facto form of cash in cryptocurrency markets.  Tether's price rose above $1.004 as bitcoin started falling early Sunday. That was tether's highest level since March 2020, when the likely economic damaged from the coronavirus and related documents first became apparent, triggering a sell-off in a broad range of assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies. Robbie Liu, market analyst at OKEx Insights, said tether's price increase may also be the result of demand from cryptocurrency derivatives traders who scrambled to line up USDT as collateral to meet margin calls.""First, the price of bitcoin dropped, and then the tether premium started to spike,"" Liu said. ""This market behavior is consistent with the previous flash crash, seen on February 22.""Read More: First Mover: Laser Eyes Can’t Stop Correction as Bitcoin Tumbles to $53KAdding to the picture, tether's price in Chinese yuan (CNY) was sold at a premium on crypto exchange Huobi's over-the-counter (OTC) desk even before Sunday's market correction.Under normal market conditions, the price of tether expressed in yuan should match that of the U.S. dollar's exchange rate with the Asian currency. A spokesperson from Huobi told CoinDesk that the connection between the timeline of the ""tether premium"" on Huobi's OTC desk and Sunday's sell-off is not ""strong.""Instead, the price for the tether-CNY pair has traded at a significant premium recently. That price gap suggests there was elevated demand from Chinese traders and investors, who routinely use dollar-pegged stablecoins as an on-ramp to cryptocurrency markets. Fiat-to-crypto trading, or buying digital assets with government-issued cash, is banned in China.Du Jun, co-founder of Huobi, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that the USDT premium over the Chinese yuan happened as many traders were cashing out their crypto profits from the sharp price runup in many alternative cryptocurrencies that occurred in prior weeks.The recent frenzy over dogecoin (DOGE) and other altcoins has attracted new investors to the crypto market from China, Du said, helping to cause the ""tether premium"" as demand for stablecoins rose on the OTC desk.The sudden rise of dogecoin's value this month had pushed the total market capitalization of the dog-themed joke token above that of xrp (XRP), historically one of the largest cryptocurrencies. At press time, dogecoin was the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market capitalization of nearly $50 billion, according to Messari. ""There are many reasons for the appearance of the tether premium, but at the core, it is about the supply and demand,"" Du said. ",2021-04-20
3818,"Is the dogecoin joke really on us pundits who try to make sense of the whole thing?That’s essentially the take from Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal today. The Shiba Inu phenomenon has nothing to do with decentralization or stores of value or any other high-minded crypto concept like bitcoin, he writes. It’s beyond serious explanation.“Nobody can talk with a straight face when it comes to dogecoin,” he writes. “... Really, all the talking points go out the window with DOGE.”“Bitcoiners who have made an extraordinary sum of money in a short period of time love to talk about how they’re taking on the [Federal Reserve] or taking on the banks or enabling some kind of peaceful revolution … Basically, dogecoin is like bitcoin stripped of the virtue signaling.”The ultimate meme-coin has jumped from less than $0.02 at the end of January to more than $0.40 last night. Its market cap is now $50 billion-plus, according to CoinDesk’s numbers. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing. Today is #DogeDay on Twitter and the coin is set to win more internet friends.Brands are noticing. Last week, meat stick maker Slim Jim unveiled its dogecoin “strategy,” pushing another ATH. And today the Mars confectionery company is promoting its Snickers and Milky Way brands with “Dogecoinrise” labels.There have been many attempts to explain DOGE, including on these pages. CoinDesk’s Emily Parker said it represented a victory of “collective belief” and a longing for a purer form of crypto (i.e., for bitcoin before it became a mainstream thing).Adam Levine, our podcast editor, said last week that DOGE had become “the joke currency to beat” in light of the Slim Jim news.“Just as bitcoin is the consensus pick for people looking for ‘predictable moneyness’ in their currency, dogecoin is looking like the consensus pick for people who want ‘meme-y wackiness’ in their currency,” he wrote.He added: “Everybody wants to be in on the joke, which pushes up the price, which makes the joke even bigger. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle. Sort of like bitcoin but for the luls.”See also: Michael Casey – Memes Mean MoneyWeisenthal isn’t having any of this high-mindedness, because the point of DOGE is essentially anti-intellectual.This may be hard to take for people who believe in crypto’s ameliorative potential. But Weisenthal is surely right that you can spend too much time trying to understand the mind of the internet. Dogecoin is a joke and it’s funnier because the price goes higher and more people are laughing at it. That’s it.Whatever the long-term implications of meme-culture for companies and society (including the scary notion that memes may be as important now as, say, product development), let’s leave the intellectualizing for another time. On Dogeday, it's enough to sit back and enjoy the fun of this runaway train careering through another station. ",2021-04-20
3819,"Traditional Indian financial institutions may face “competitive pressure” from blockchain-based platforms, including Ripple, in areas such as cross-border payments, according to a new paper on blockchain technology and competition from consultancy Ernst & Young (EY) for the Competition Commission of India (CCI).“Theoretically, it is expected that once blockchain applications cross the pilot and proof of concept stage, they will compete with other systems/technologies providing similar services that may not be based on blockchain technology,” the authors of the paper wrote, adding: The authors suggested that because Ripple is faster, less expensive and more transparent it could put “competitive pressure” on India’s traditional banking system.Blockchain payments company Ripple offers services across 55 countries, according to the firm. It has also positioned its cryptocurrency, XRP, as a “neutral bridge” to link various central bank digital currencies, as it detailed in a recent white paper. In the U.S., Ripple has recently been embroiled in a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission alleging it violated securities laws by selling XRP to retail consumers because the regulator considers  it a security. A recent op-ed from the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal criticized the regulator for “creating danger for currency developers and retail investors” and the “inconsistency” of its approach, given that bitcoin and ether are exempt from the same rules. “The market considers them similar. We consider them similar,” Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said on CoinDesk TV earlier this month, speaking of XRP and bitcoin. The authors of the EY paper noted that in India, cryptocurrencies “have received a great deal of regulatory attention over the past several years, culminating in a recent recommendation by an inter-ministerial committee to ban trading and holding of cryptocurrency.” The Reserve Bank of India, the country’s central bank, barred domestic banks from “dealing with cryptocurrency firms and their exchanges” in 2018, they continued, with petitions going up to the Supreme Court to rescind the ban. The court ruled against the RBI in March 2020, but Indian government officials have continued to consider moving against cryptocurrencies. Despite these legal actions, some Indian state governments have worked to implement blockchain technology for various applications, including land ownership records and birth certificates, according to the paper. There have also been blockchain-based pilot projects and proofs of concept in sectors such as tech, health care and agriculture in the country. ",2021-04-20
3820,"Conflux, a public blockchain endorsed by the Shanghainese government, is launching a cross-chain bridge to facilitate easier operations among three of Asia’s largest crypto exchanges – Binance, OKEx and Huobi – as well as Ethereum. The cross-chain bridge, called ShuttleFlow, will enable digital asset swaps between and across the Conflux network, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi ECO Chain and OKex Chain, the firm announced Tuesday. In other words, a user can take an asset on one of these networks and convert it into an asset on a different one. The ShuttleFlow solution is the first cross-chain bridge to support Asia’s most widely used digital asset exchanges, according to a press statement shared with CoinDesk.“The name ‘ShuttleFlow’ means allowing assets to flow between multiple public chains as freely as water,” Eden Dhaliwal, global managing director at Conflux, told CoinDesk via an email.  Increasingly more crypto firms are coming up with cross-chain liquidity and interoperability solutions for decentralized finance (DeFi). Earlier this month, decentralized liquidity network Thorchain launched cross-chain trading of cryptocurrencies. In March, Alameda Research invested $20 million in cross-chain DeFi platform Reef Finance.  ShuttleFlow’s multi-chain capabilities are twofold, Dhaliwal explained. First, it provides decentralized app (dapp) developers with solutions to integrate multi-chain asset deposits and withdrawals at a low cost, he said. “As a project, the Conflux Foundation has historically covered all or most of the Ethereum gas fees associated with transactions, in order to facilitate the onboarding of new users who typically experiment with lower dollar amounts,” Dhaliwal said, adding that now, dapps building on Conflux can sponsor transactions with their own CFX (Conflux's native token), or open it up as a donation and let users cover the gas fees. Since the launch of the mainnet, there have been over 5 million transactions with a combined gas cost of just $90 across the entire chain, Dhaliwal added.Second, ShuttleFlow uses the Conflux Network as a “transit chain” to build asset bridges and other related infrastructure across DeFi blockchains, Dhaliwal said. This means the solution can facilitate swaps directly between two external blockchains like Ethereum and Binance, according to the statement shared with CoinDesk.  A testnet version of ShuttleFlow was launched in the first quarter of 2020, supporting over 49 assets including bitcoin and ether, the statement said. In September 2020, the first cross-chain multi-asset migration of digital assets (worth over $7.6 million) was completed. Since then the ShuttleFlow protocol has moved over $120 million in assets, Dhaliwal said.",2021-04-20
3821,"Some bitcoin traders appear to be locking in options market bets to protect themselves from further price drops in the wake of the cryptocurrency's recent slide to three-week lows. Short-term put options on bitcoin, or bearish bets, are drawing higher prices than calls, or bullish bets. The one-week ""put-call skew,"" which measures this dynamic, has jumped to 26%, the highest since Oct. 2, according to data provider Skew. The one-month gauge has risen to a three-week high of 8%. Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled 6.3% on Sunday, the biggest single-day decline in almost two months, after disruptions at coal plants in Xinjiang and other parts of China last week knocked out bitcoin miners in the region. The Bitcoin blockchain's hash rate – the amount of computing power devoted to securing the network – slid by 46% to 106 exahashes (quintillion computations) per second, the lowest since November. Bitcoin was trading near $56,300 at press time after sliding as low as $53,400 earlier Tuesday, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The put-call skew is a gauge of the value of puts relative to calls; a positive skew implies that demand for puts (bearish options bets) is outstripping calls (bullish bets). Positive one-week and one-month skews do not necessarily mean that traders have turned bearish on the cryptocurrency. They could be buying ""protective puts"" – purchasing puts against long bitcoin positions in the spot or futures market. ""Puts at $52,000 and $54,000 strikes for April 23 and April 23 expiry have been in demand since last week, which has caused the short-term skews to go into positive territory,"" Swiss-based data tracker Laevitas told CoinDesk.Some institutional investors bought bitcoin on Sunday as prices dipped to $51,248.  ""Our desk has been a net purchaser over the past 24-48 hours,"" Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG, a bitcoin-focused investment manager, wrote Monday in an email to subscribers.Some bitcoin buyers may have bought put options for downside protection, pushing up the put-call skew.

""Our risk models use it as one of the inputs, and it has a positive correlation weight."" Terman added that the decline in the Bitcoin blockchain's hash rate was very pronounced over the last week and easily could have triggered some selling if algorithm-powered investment funds were at a tipping point already due to other factors. Also read: If Bitcoin Starts Closing Below the 50-Day SMA It May Mean Deeper Pullback Ahead",2021-04-20

The current retail fervor probably won’t completely give up on dogecoin, but a sell-the-event reaction could be in the cards.""The DOGE dump came even as at least one analyst, Bloomberg Intelligence's Mike McGlone, wrote that the cryptocurrency might be due for further gains. “Gaining somewhat of a global cult following, we see little to stop DOGE from continuing to appreciate, at least in the near term,” McGlone, a commodity strategist known for his prescient bitcoin price predictions last year, wrote Tuesday in a report. ""Dogecoin may be casino-like fun."" It was a shot of water in the face for DOGE fans who may have instead been looking for a treat – in the form of fast profits or instant fortunes. A remaining question is whether this year's gains in dogecoin might draw fresh capital and labor to the  project, similar to the way last year's pump in GameStop shares led to a $1 billion capital raise, a search for new management and potentially a transition to an e-commerce strategy. At one point, dogecoin had a market value bigger than the centuries-old U.K. bank Barclays. Blockchain data shows that activity is increasing on the network: Active Dogecoin addresses have climbed to record, and transactions are at a seven-year high, according to the analytics firm Coin Metrics. CoinDesk reported earlier this year that project development on the blockchain has picked up, with top contributions from Bitcoin Core developers, based on activity on the open-source software site GitHub.    Within broader digital-asset markets, the DOGE frenzy appeared to spread to decentralized finance (DeFi), where several imitator tokens have chalked up staggering single-day gains.The first is SHIB (get it? Shiba Inu?), a decentralized experimental token nicknamed the ""dogecoin killer,"" trading on the decentralized exchange Uniswap. The token, launched under the Ethereum blockchain's ERC-20 standard, has rallied over 5,000% in the past four weeks and rose 95% on Monday alongside DOGE's rally to record highs near 43 cents. The coin has registered a trading volume of over $200 million in the past 24 hours, Uniswap data shows.Another coin, weed doge (WOGE), launched this week, allegedly in a bid to donate funds to people considered unjustly jailed for marijuana-related offenses. WOGE rallied 1,058% from to $0.0950 on Monday though was last seen trading near $0.0170 on Uniswap. ""Since DOGE has been taking care of us and providing us with godly profits this bull run, we also wanted to create a meaningful coin that gives back to the people in a handful of ways,"" says a post on CryptoMoonShots Reddit page. Most of this ridiculousness is seen as evidence of froth in cryptocurrency markets, at a time when bitcoin prices have doubled this year – ostensibly as a hedge against inflation, in the wake of trillions of dollars of money printing by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.     Bloomberg's McGlone noted that dogecoin had demonstrated ""divergent strength"" as bitcoin's price has retreated in recent days. The report was published prior to Tuesday's losses in dogecoin. But sometimes, apparently, the DOGE doesn't come when called. ",2021-04-20
3826,"In many aspects of life, we have a tendency to assume a zero–sum approach to decision-making. What is good for one side is decidedly and proportionately disadvantageous for the other: Heads I win, tails you lose. You are either a dog or cat person, a skier or a snowboarder, prefer the aisle or window seat. But nothing is one dimensional in today’s complex and multi-faceted investment universe. The vast majority of decisions are actually non-zero-sum, especially if we consider the trillions upon trillions that comprise the global capital markets. When it comes to cryptocurrencies and gold, the popular narrative is that the former is stealing the latter’s thunder – crypto's gains are gold’s losses. Again, the impulse to distill it down to an either/or scenario comes with a very costly lesson, your money. The prudent asset mix considers the maximum return for the lowest level of volatility. As in the case of gold and crypto, each fulfils a complementary function as a repository of value in a global context of uncertainty and looming inflation.  The gold market is estimated at over $11 trillion, which reflects a 2,500-year head start as a globally recognized medium of exchange and value. By contrast, bitcoin has a market cap of about $1 trillion. Even the amount of physical gold held by central banks and investors equates to many times bitcoin’s current market. In 2020, gold’s average daily volume was $125 billion, or roughly 30 times bitcoin’s daily spot volume of some $4 billion. Notwithstanding, both assets have highly liquid markets, meaning there is undeniably ample space for both crypto and gold to flourish.So, rather than view crypto and gold as competitors, an acceptable analogy might be to consider crypto as the legitimate offspring, or spinoff, with certain common markers. They both have low correlation to other families of assets, and they are inflation–sensitive, great diversifiers and alternatives to fiat issues. Gold is a reliable, age-old secure store of value, and the other a new generation that is growing and evolving, quick to react but lacking the wisdom of longevity.  While investors in the U.S. are jumping onto the crypto bandwagon – which might create the impression that gold is passé – elsewhere in the world, people long accustomed to buying gold are only now open to considering crypto. Investors should be cautious that investing in crypto at the wrong time can result in rapid and severe losses. Anything that can appreciate unimaginably quickly may be prone to severe corrections. Nothing is guaranteed. While crypto is embraced in North America and some other countries, it is practically banned in China and frowned upon in South Korea.  As a believer in both gold and crypto (particularly DeFi), I can envision gold’s reinstatement in North American portfolios at $2,200 highs. That doesn’t preclude investors from diversifying into other asset classes such as crypto. There are already signs of inflation, much more so than the feds would have you believe, and as governments continue to print money, it will continue its upward trajectory. That means the price of gold, bitcoin, ethereum and critically decentralized finance (DeFi) will all benefit. The view held by Peter Schiff, a former chief economist and strategist of Euro Pacific Capital, that cryptocurrencies are not money and that investments in them are foolhardy, is flawed in my opinion. Inarguably, the value of anything lies in what one is willing to pay for it. The fate of any currency, digital or otherwise, is in the hands of the financial institutions and credit card companies that actualize its relevance. As DeFi protocols grow, built off the back of Ethereum and Bitcoin, you simply can't argue that these digital entities have no value. Crypto’s value, driven by DeFi alone, could make it worth the value of all the traditional financial markets.  The psychology of investing has shown that reasonable and rational behavior almost never coincide. One might think that a bitcoin necklace is worthless, when in reality, it’s not. There are very astute institutional investors and savvy legendary macro investors who believe that crypto is the future because it’s creating a crypto-economy that can run without government–based monopolies that exist now. Think of it as Facebook 2.0 or Email 2.0 – back in the mid-1990s, email (and certainly Facebook) barely existed. Email was a burgeoning novelty appreciated by few; no one expected to use email as legal tender, or was convinced the internet was safe. Yet look at where we are today. Things change before we know it, which lends credence to the notion that cryptocurrencies and destabilizing DeFi protocols are here to stay. The benefits of crypto, DeFi and blockchain technology are immense – whether it’s Know Your Client (KYC), the elimination of terrorist financing, or eliminating proceeds of crime – cannot be underestimated. These protocols are significant advantages over gold, which can be made untraceable. Some still think the Nazi gold hordes reside in gold vaults all over the world – no one can argue these are not direct proceeds of terrorism. If we foresee a place for gold and crypto in the future, over time I expect they will couple and correlate. That’s if the past is any indication. If bitcoin can conceivably reach $80,000–$100,000, and gold $3,500–$5,000 in the near to medium term, people will be likely to invest in both. And the DeFi protocols that grow off the Ethereum/Bitcoin and other blockchains may be worth hundreds of thousands of multiples more.No, crypto is not likely to replace gold. They are two sides of a coin, the patriarch and progeny, each in a position to benefit from the other’s experience and perspective.",2021-04-20
3827,"Tether (USDT), the oldest and most popular stablecoin, diverged significantly from its peg to the U.S. dollar during bitcoin's (BTC) recent price drop.But rather than seeing the move as a defect of the stablecoin, whose market cap stands at $52 billion, some analysts and exchange executives say the ""tether premium"" shows the token's growing use as a safe-haven asset in almost-anything-can-happen-at-anytime cryptocurrency markets.    ""During a crash, traders will race to sell their bitcoin in exchange for tether, which is similar to the U.S. dollar in that it is recognized as a temporary safe haven amidst extreme price volatility,"" Kaiko, a blockchain data analytics firm, wrote in an April 19 newsletter. ""A sudden increase in buying pressure for tether often has the effect of causing positive drift from the stablecoin's one-to-one peg.""The idea of tether as a safe haven might seem incongruous, given the nagging questions over the stablecoin issuer's credibility and financial backing. The company behind the stablecoin published an attestation in late March to verify its assets, after agreeing to an $18.5 million settlement with prosecutors in New York state. Yet tether's market value has more than doubled from about $20 billion at the start of the year, a sign of traders' growing embrace of the stablecoin's convenience and efficiency as the de facto form of cash in cryptocurrency markets.  Tether's price rose above $1.004 as bitcoin started falling early Sunday. That was tether's highest level since March 2020, when the likely economic damaged from the coronavirus and related documents first became apparent, triggering a sell-off in a broad range of assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies. Robbie Liu, market analyst at OKEx Insights, said tether's price increase may also be the result of demand from cryptocurrency derivatives traders who scrambled to line up USDT as collateral to meet margin calls.""First, the price of bitcoin dropped, and then the tether premium started to spike,"" Liu said. ""This market behavior is consistent with the previous flash crash, seen on February 22.""Read More: First Mover: Laser Eyes Can’t Stop Correction as Bitcoin Tumbles to $53KAdding to the picture, tether's price in Chinese yuan (CNY) was sold at a premium on crypto exchange Huobi's over-the-counter (OTC) desk even before Sunday's market correction.Under normal market conditions, the price of tether expressed in yuan should match that of the U.S. dollar's exchange rate with the Asian currency. A spokesperson from Huobi told CoinDesk that the connection between the timeline of the ""tether premium"" on Huobi's OTC desk and Sunday's sell-off is not ""strong.""Instead, the price for the tether-CNY pair has traded at a significant premium recently. That price gap suggests there was elevated demand from Chinese traders and investors, who routinely use dollar-pegged stablecoins as an on-ramp to cryptocurrency markets. Fiat-to-crypto trading, or buying digital assets with government-issued cash, is banned in China.Du Jun, co-founder of Huobi, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that the USDT premium over the Chinese yuan happened as many traders were cashing out their crypto profits from the sharp price runup in many alternative cryptocurrencies that occurred in prior weeks.The recent frenzy over dogecoin (DOGE) and other altcoins has attracted new investors to the crypto market from China, Du said, helping to cause the ""tether premium"" as demand for stablecoins rose on the OTC desk.The sudden rise of dogecoin's value this month had pushed the total market capitalization of the dog-themed joke token above that of xrp (XRP), historically one of the largest cryptocurrencies. At press time, dogecoin was the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market capitalization of nearly $50 billion, according to Messari. ""There are many reasons for the appearance of the tether premium, but at the core, it is about the supply and demand,"" Du said. ",2021-04-20
3828,"Is the dogecoin joke really on us pundits who try to make sense of the whole thing?That’s essentially the take from Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal today. The Shiba Inu phenomenon has nothing to do with decentralization or stores of value or any other high-minded crypto concept like bitcoin, he writes. It’s beyond serious explanation.“Nobody can talk with a straight face when it comes to dogecoin,” he writes. “... Really, all the talking points go out the window with DOGE.”“Bitcoiners who have made an extraordinary sum of money in a short period of time love to talk about how they’re taking on the [Federal Reserve] or taking on the banks or enabling some kind of peaceful revolution … Basically, dogecoin is like bitcoin stripped of the virtue signaling.”The ultimate meme-coin has jumped from less than $0.02 at the end of January to more than $0.40 last night. Its market cap is now $50 billion-plus, according to CoinDesk’s numbers. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing. Today is #DogeDay on Twitter and the coin is set to win more internet friends.Brands are noticing. Last week, meat stick maker Slim Jim unveiled its dogecoin “strategy,” pushing another ATH. And today the Mars confectionery company is promoting its Snickers and Milky Way brands with “Dogecoinrise” labels.There have been many attempts to explain DOGE, including on these pages. CoinDesk’s Emily Parker said it represented a victory of “collective belief” and a longing for a purer form of crypto (i.e., for bitcoin before it became a mainstream thing).Adam Levine, our podcast editor, said last week that DOGE had become “the joke currency to beat” in light of the Slim Jim news.“Just as bitcoin is the consensus pick for people looking for ‘predictable moneyness’ in their currency, dogecoin is looking like the consensus pick for people who want ‘meme-y wackiness’ in their currency,” he wrote.He added: “Everybody wants to be in on the joke, which pushes up the price, which makes the joke even bigger. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle. Sort of like bitcoin but for the luls.”See also: Michael Casey – Memes Mean MoneyWeisenthal isn’t having any of this high-mindedness, because the point of DOGE is essentially anti-intellectual.This may be hard to take for people who believe in crypto’s ameliorative potential. But Weisenthal is surely right that you can spend too much time trying to understand the mind of the internet. Dogecoin is a joke and it’s funnier because the price goes higher and more people are laughing at it. That’s it.Whatever the long-term implications of meme-culture for companies and society (including the scary notion that memes may be as important now as, say, product development), let’s leave the intellectualizing for another time. On Dogeday, it's enough to sit back and enjoy the fun of this runaway train careering through another station. ",2021-04-20
3829,"Traditional Indian financial institutions may face “competitive pressure” from blockchain-based platforms, including Ripple, in areas such as cross-border payments, according to a new paper on blockchain technology and competition from consultancy Ernst & Young (EY) for the Competition Commission of India (CCI).“Theoretically, it is expected that once blockchain applications cross the pilot and proof of concept stage, they will compete with other systems/technologies providing similar services that may not be based on blockchain technology,” the authors of the paper wrote, adding: The authors suggested that because Ripple is faster, less expensive and more transparent it could put “competitive pressure” on India’s traditional banking system.Blockchain payments company Ripple offers services across 55 countries, according to the firm. It has also positioned its cryptocurrency, XRP, as a “neutral bridge” to link various central bank digital currencies, as it detailed in a recent white paper. In the U.S., Ripple has recently been embroiled in a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission alleging it violated securities laws by selling XRP to retail consumers because the regulator considers  it a security. A recent op-ed from the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal criticized the regulator for “creating danger for currency developers and retail investors” and the “inconsistency” of its approach, given that bitcoin and ether are exempt from the same rules. “The market considers them similar. We consider them similar,” Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said on CoinDesk TV earlier this month, speaking of XRP and bitcoin. The authors of the EY paper noted that in India, cryptocurrencies “have received a great deal of regulatory attention over the past several years, culminating in a recent recommendation by an inter-ministerial committee to ban trading and holding of cryptocurrency.” The Reserve Bank of India, the country’s central bank, barred domestic banks from “dealing with cryptocurrency firms and their exchanges” in 2018, they continued, with petitions going up to the Supreme Court to rescind the ban. The court ruled against the RBI in March 2020, but Indian government officials have continued to consider moving against cryptocurrencies. Despite these legal actions, some Indian state governments have worked to implement blockchain technology for various applications, including land ownership records and birth certificates, according to the paper. There have also been blockchain-based pilot projects and proofs of concept in sectors such as tech, health care and agriculture in the country. ",2021-04-20
3830,"Conflux, a public blockchain endorsed by the Shanghainese government, is launching a cross-chain bridge to facilitate easier operations among three of Asia’s largest crypto exchanges – Binance, OKEx and Huobi – as well as Ethereum. The cross-chain bridge, called ShuttleFlow, will enable digital asset swaps between and across the Conflux network, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Huobi ECO Chain and OKex Chain, the firm announced Tuesday. In other words, a user can take an asset on one of these networks and convert it into an asset on a different one. The ShuttleFlow solution is the first cross-chain bridge to support Asia’s most widely used digital asset exchanges, according to a press statement shared with CoinDesk.“The name ‘ShuttleFlow’ means allowing assets to flow between multiple public chains as freely as water,” Eden Dhaliwal, global managing director at Conflux, told CoinDesk via an email.  Increasingly more crypto firms are coming up with cross-chain liquidity and interoperability solutions for decentralized finance (DeFi). Earlier this month, decentralized liquidity network Thorchain launched cross-chain trading of cryptocurrencies. In March, Alameda Research invested $20 million in cross-chain DeFi platform Reef Finance.  ShuttleFlow’s multi-chain capabilities are twofold, Dhaliwal explained. First, it provides decentralized app (dapp) developers with solutions to integrate multi-chain asset deposits and withdrawals at a low cost, he said. “As a project, the Conflux Foundation has historically covered all or most of the Ethereum gas fees associated with transactions, in order to facilitate the onboarding of new users who typically experiment with lower dollar amounts,” Dhaliwal said, adding that now, dapps building on Conflux can sponsor transactions with their own CFX (Conflux's native token), or open it up as a donation and let users cover the gas fees. Since the launch of the mainnet, there have been over 5 million transactions with a combined gas cost of just $90 across the entire chain, Dhaliwal added.Second, ShuttleFlow uses the Conflux Network as a “transit chain” to build asset bridges and other related infrastructure across DeFi blockchains, Dhaliwal said. This means the solution can facilitate swaps directly between two external blockchains like Ethereum and Binance, according to the statement shared with CoinDesk.  A testnet version of ShuttleFlow was launched in the first quarter of 2020, supporting over 49 assets including bitcoin and ether, the statement said. In September 2020, the first cross-chain multi-asset migration of digital assets (worth over $7.6 million) was completed. Since then the ShuttleFlow protocol has moved over $120 million in assets, Dhaliwal said.",2021-04-20
3831,"Some bitcoin traders appear to be locking in options market bets to protect themselves from further price drops in the wake of the cryptocurrency's recent slide to three-week lows. Short-term put options on bitcoin, or bearish bets, are drawing higher prices than calls, or bullish bets. The one-week ""put-call skew,"" which measures this dynamic, has jumped to 26%, the highest since Oct. 2, according to data provider Skew. The one-month gauge has risen to a three-week high of 8%. Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled 6.3% on Sunday, the biggest single-day decline in almost two months, after disruptions at coal plants in Xinjiang and other parts of China last week knocked out bitcoin miners in the region. The Bitcoin blockchain's hash rate – the amount of computing power devoted to securing the network – slid by 46% to 106 exahashes (quintillion computations) per second, the lowest since November. Bitcoin was trading near $56,300 at press time after sliding as low as $53,400 earlier Tuesday, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The put-call skew is a gauge of the value of puts relative to calls; a positive skew implies that demand for puts (bearish options bets) is outstripping calls (bullish bets). Positive one-week and one-month skews do not necessarily mean that traders have turned bearish on the cryptocurrency. They could be buying ""protective puts"" – purchasing puts against long bitcoin positions in the spot or futures market. ""Puts at $52,000 and $54,000 strikes for April 23 and April 23 expiry have been in demand since last week, which has caused the short-term skews to go into positive territory,"" Swiss-based data tracker Laevitas told CoinDesk.Some institutional investors bought bitcoin on Sunday as prices dipped to $51,248.  ""Our desk has been a net purchaser over the past 24-48 hours,"" Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG, a bitcoin-focused investment manager, wrote Monday in an email to subscribers.Some bitcoin buyers may have bought put options for downside protection, pushing up the put-call skew. The one-week gauge has increased from roughly 6% since SundayWhile demand for short-term puts has spiked, long-term put-call skews remain well below zero, indicating continued bias for calls. Some bitcoin miners may also have been purchasers of downside protection, traders said.""The trend in the hashrate does have a positive correlation with the price movement but usually on a longer-term perspective,"" Marcie Terman, COO of crypto hedge fund Panxora Group said in a LinkedIn chat. ""Our risk models use it as one of the inputs, and it has a positive correlation weight."" Terman added that the decline in the Bitcoin blockchain's hash rate was very pronounced over the last week and easily could have triggered some selling if algorithm-powered investment funds were at a tipping point already due to other factors. Also read: If Bitcoin Starts Closing Below the 50-Day SMA It May Mean Deeper Pullback Ahead",2021-04-20

3834,"Analysts on Silvergate Bank’s Q1 earnings call pressed executives on how the crypto-friendly institution will make more money on excess cash in a low-interest rate environment, despite the company's gangbusters results.The La Jolla, Calif.-based bank, which serves major crypto firms such as Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken, added a record 135 digital currency customers in Q1--more than it added in all of 2020. Crypto firms are often a rich source of low-cost deposits for the few banks that openly serve the sector. In Q1, Silvergate’s average cost of deposits was 0.00%. In contrast, average deposit costs for mid-cap commercial banks are normally around 0.75% to 1.25%.However, analysts on Tuesday’s call were especially curious about what Silvergate was doing to increase interest income from customers like stablecoin issuers, the day after Circle announced that Silvergate banking rival Signature would become its primary banking partner to hold USD Coin deposits. Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said that while Silvergate allows stablecoin issuers to mint and burn stablecoins on the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), the bank's fiat on-ramp for bitcoin markets, it isn't interested in being the primary bank for stablecoin reserves which would double or triple the bank’s balance sheet size.“We're in the lowest interest rate environment in my lifetime,” Lane said. “There's not a lot of places that you can go to earn yield on that excess cash.”Bank analysts also pushed the bankers on what they would do with the excess cash Silvergate had raked in from the rest of its digital currency customers. Lane noted that while the bank could “juice short-term earnings” by putting the deposits into high-yield, longer-duration securities, it wouldn’t be sustainable long term because crypto firms want to use SEN as a highly liquid network to use as a fiat on ramp for trading on nights and weekends.“It’s not that we don’t have comfort in putting the cash out,” Lane said in regards to lending out deposits for crypto customers. “All of that gets calibrated in how we manage our liquidity, and I’m very confident that over time we will be generating a nice net interest income in addition to growing fee income.”By the numbersThe tough questioning from analysts came despite big gains in fee income and transaction revenue.The SEN processed 166,772 transactions and transferred $166.5 billion over the network during Q1, up 83% and 181% respectively. Q1 net income was $12.7 million, up 40% over Q4.Fee income driven by cash management accounts for crypto firms rose to $7.1 million from $3.8 million in the previous quarter.The bank’s average total digital currency deposits during Q1 were $6.4 billion, the high and low daily total digital currency deposit levels were $8.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. Overall, digital currency customer deposits grew by $1.8 billion in the quarter. The bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio – which measures equity capital against risk-weighted assets – remained well above the regulatory threshold of 5% at 9.68%.LendingSEN Leverage, Silvergate’s bitcoin-backed lending business that is tied to the SEN, is another place for the bank to deploy new deposits in addition to its traditional commercial real estate (CRE) lending business. The bank processed $117.3 million in SEN Leverage loans in Q1, a 52% increase from the previous quarter and monumental increase from the $2 million in bitcoin-backed loans it did in the same quarter last year. Silvergate’s total loans--including traditional CRE--were $1.6 billion at the end of the last quarter.Approved credit lines for SEN Leverage increased to $196.5 million in Q1, up from $82.5 million in the prior quarter. In March, the bank announced that it would be extending bitcoin-backed loans to Fidelity clients, and it already works with Coinbase Custody, Bitstamp and Anchorage. Partnering with custodians also gives Silvergate more exposure to new institutional customers who are looking for leverage, added Chief Strategy Officer Ben Reynolds. Noninterest expense has increased by 11% quarter-over-quarter, which included research and development expenses for new products coming in the future, Reynolds added. “Bitcoin grew by approximately $500 billion during the first quarter alone,” Reynolds saaid. “At the same time, we’re not aware of any significant new competitors that are willing to provide US dollar funding that’s collateralized by bitcoin. While the asset values of bitcoin and the demand for leverage increased significantly, the supply of US dollars for funding and leverage remain constant.”While less than 10% of the 695 institutions banking with Silvergate are currently taking advantage of SEN, the bank does expect at least 80% of those customers to use the product over time, Reynolds said.Lane described his intention to create a “network of custodians” so that customers don’t have to move their bitcoin when the bank is offering cash loans against it.",2021-04-20
3835,"Publicly traded bitcoin mining company Bitfarms (TSXV:BITF, OTC:BFARF) has signed an agreement under which it can draw up to 210 megawatts of electricity for its planned mining facility in Argentina.The initial term of the contract with a private Argentinian power producer is eight years, the company said in an announcement Monday, with an effective cost of $0.022 per kilowatt-hour for the electricity for the first four years.In October, Bitfarms had agreed to develop a 60 MW bitcoin mining operation in Argentina, noting a “favorable year-round climate” for the facility, which the company said will be a “significant contributor” to its target of 8.0 exahash/second by the end of 2022 and “provide geographic production diversification to reduce risk.” “Our planned expansion in Argentina is a continuation of our experience and our desire to deliver value to shareholders,” said Bitfarms President Geoffrey Morphy. “The strategic expansion provides the scale and efficiency that we were seeking.”“With considerable low-cost power available to us over many years, we can enhance our margin performance in the short term and ensure we have a viable operation on which we can count through and after the next halving event in 2024,” Morphy said.According to Bitfarms’ announcement, the “210 MW is sufficient to support approximately 55,000 new-generation miners, which could generate approximately $650 million of revenues or 11,774 BTC, based on current difficulty levels and a bitcoin price of $55,000.” Bitfarms now has five industrial-scale hydroelectric facilities in Québec, Canada, with a combined capacity of 69 MW. The company is also preparing for a Nasdaq listing in a U.S. push. In recent months, Bitfarms has purchased tens of thousands of bitcoin mining machines as part of its wider expansion efforts. In early March, it disclosed plans to buy 48,000 MicroBT mining machines.  A “substantial portion” of those miners are destined for the Argentinian facility, Bitfarms said Monday. Bitfarms also announced Friday that it had purchased an additional 1,996 new MicroBT mining machines, which will be installed through August and will provide an extra 160 petahash per second.  According to Ben Gagnon, director of mining operations at Bitfarms, there has never been as much capital ready to be used in North American markets as there is right now as a result of coronavirus lockdowns.“How do you invest capital in a market like this? Bitcoin mining is the perfect candidate,"" he told CoinDesk ""It has quick ROIs (return on investments), is capitally intense, can utilize turn-key infrastructure and produce an asset that requires no customers and is appreciating in value faster than anything else they can produce.""The company isn’t alone in its moves toward increasing the mining footprint of North American firms. Other industrial-scale miners such as Marathon, Riot and Blockcap have purchased tens of thousands of machines in recent weeks. On Monday, DMG Blockchain Solutions, another publicly traded Canadian bitcoin mining company, purchased 3,600 application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines. ",2021-04-19
3836,"The bitcoin market saw spot volumes not witnessed since February and record derivatives action over the weekend.

The leveraged wipeouts are a record level that surpasses a previous record set in February. “As usual, the primary reason was a combination of over-leveraged derivative traders,” Lau told CoinDesk.Traders are obviously trying to peer into the future to see where BTC will head this week after the dump. It may take a recovery to over $60,000 for the market to expand due to increased retail interest again while whales will scoop up more of the asset if it heads back towards $50,000, according to ExoAlpha’s Lifchitz.“Bitcoin is stuck in the $50,000-$60,000 twilight zone,” said Lifchitz. “Above $60,000 it's the retail FOMO, or Fear Of Missing Out, frenzy. Below $50,000 lay the institutional dip buyers.” According to CoinDesk 20 data, bitcoin has closed at over $60,000 only seven days, all of them in March and April. It has not closed below $50,000 since March 6.The Coinbase direct listing last week might add some padding to the market as newer investors find increased interest in crypto, said Misha Alefirenko, co-founder of crypto market maker Velvetformula. “Retail investors are finally in the game with all the buzz around the Coinbase listing,” Alefirenko said.Read More: Coinbase Going Public Isn’t Selling Out – It’s the Start of a Long GameHowever, there is still some potential for downside risk. “The bull definitely wants to take a breather,” ExoAlpha’s Lifchitz concluded. “Should the $50,000 level break, dip buyers would be submerged by sellers, then $30,000 looks like the obvious next stop, but we are not there yet.”OKCoin’s Lau sees long-term bullish fundamentals, however, given continued positive statements from central banks regarding crypto. He pointed to China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), as an example.“Longer term, the prospects for bitcoin remain bright, buoyed by encouraging statements by the PBOC that bitcoin is emerging as an investable asset class,” Lau said. “This potentially marks a shift in tone towards bitcoin from the world's second largest economy's central bank.”Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Monday trading around $2,182 and falling 0.53% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).Since the start of 2021, ether’s price has appreciated over 208% as of CoinDesk daily closing price information from Jan. 1 to April 18. Stefan Coolican, chief financial officer of investment firm Ether Capital, says despite some red on the trading screens in the past few days, investors are bullish, anticipating a solution to Ethereum’s fee problems. Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which is expected to help solve constraints in the network’s decentralized application functionality due to high fees, should be arriving in the next few months. Read More: Ethereum’s ‘EIP 1559’ Fee Market Overhaul Greenlit for July“I think EIP 1559 in the summer and the ETH2 merge getting prioritized is very bullish on the ETH value proposition, but this is more of a longer-term six- to 12-month play,” Coolican told CoinDesk.The perennial meme-maker token dogecoin experienced big-time gains Monday. It rose more than 19% the past day, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The rise comes ahead of what some fans of the token have been referring to as “Dogeday,” on Tuesday seen as an occasion for celebrating the token, and perhaps pumping its price. (The date also happens to be April 20, an occasion for celebration by marijuana enthusiasts.)Ether Capital’s Coolican also noted solana (SOL) was a surprise gainer over the past 24 hours, with data aggregator CoinGecko tallying a 13% gain for the blockchain development project over the past 24 hours. “SOL seemed to be one of the only tokens that was actually bid this weekend as everything else was getting crushed,” he said. “Not sure why.”Read More: Dogecoin Eclipses XRP as 4th-Largest Cryptocurrency Ahead of ‘Dogeday’Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the red Monday.

3842,"New York City needs to think creatively about its post-pandemic recovery, says a candidate for city comptroller. This includes investments in the city’s blockchain industry. Reshma Patel, a Democratic candidate for the city’s chief financial officer position, unveiled a “future proof” plan for New York on Monday centered around investments in blockchain businesses and cryptocurrencies. There are 12 candidates for the office, including 10 other Democrats, according to Ballotpedia.“My reason for running for comptroller is I’m concerned about the long-term financial health of New York City, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic,” Patel told CoinDesk. She hopes that her proposal, if enacted, would increase the city’s efficiency in approving contracts, spur new businesses to operate within the city and diversify local pension funds. Under Patel’s plan, New York’s five retirement systems would invest up to 3% of their funds into cryptocurrencies, the city itself would invest in funds with blockchain exposure to help support fintech startups and New York would utilize a blockchain-based system for its procurement contracts. Patel also wants to work with the New York Department of Financial Services to streamline the BitLicense.She sees tangible benefits in adopting a blockchain system to track and update procurement contracts. The comptroller’s office typically has 30 days to approve a contract, but depending on the project, different entities within the city government may have to weigh in. Patel said tracking changes and budget issues on a decentralized ledger would make it easier for different parties to be involved while maintaining transparency around the process. A lack of transparency currently makes it difficult to budget, take out loans or work with community efforts, she said, citing personal experience from her work in the city.Much of Patel’s proposals would require dialogue and buy-in from different parts of the city or state apparatus, she said. Patel acknowledged that the comptroller would have to work with the pension funds’ trustees to invest in crypto at all, and that this may be a difficult proposition.“As the custodian of the city’s five pension funds, the comptroller has the fiduciary responsibility to manage these funds,” she said. In her view, this means ensuring proper risk management is in place, but she sees investing in crypto as an appropriate hedge against possible inflation or the S&P 500 dropping.“With inflation expected to rise in the next few years, and bitcoin expected to continue its checkered but consistent upswing to ‘the moon,’ a minimal allocation to the most dominant of all cryptocurrencies can help diversify and protect the City’s pension fund investments,” the proposal reads.Other issues include cryptocurrencies’ environmental impact. The current city comptroller, Scott Stringer, announced a plan to divest from fossil fuels earlier this year, citing damage from climate change. The climate impact of cryptocurrencies have been under scrutiny amid the recent bull run and growth of products like non-fungible tokens. Patel believes that a move toward renewable energy sources, particularly in New York, is feasible. “The city has already made a commitment to divest from fossil fuels, and that is a commitment I would uphold,” Patel said. “This is a financial innovation and it’ll get more stable and reliable and sustainable over time, and the only way to make it more sustainable is to engage with it.”",2021-04-19

3844,"The crypto futures market saw the highest nymber of liquidations in history on Sunday as the sudden bitcoin price pullback caught overleveraged traders off guard. Exchanges offering crypto futures liquidated $10 billion worth of positions on Sunday, toppling the previous market-wide record of $5.77 billion registered on Feb. 23, according to data provider Bybt. Forced closure of long positions or bullish trades accounted for $9.26 billion, or over 90% of total liquidations, which shows the leverage was excessively skewed bullish across the board. Bitcoin futures accounted for more than 50% of total market-wide liquidations on Sunday. Liquidations happen when trades cannot fulfill margin requirements for holding long/short positions and often exacerbate bullish/bearish moves. Bitcoin dropped sharply, from $60,000 to $52,148 early Sunday, dragging alternative cryptocurrencies lower. As prices started falling, margin requirements increased and exchanges liquidated longs (squared off with offsetting shorts), adding to downward pressure in the market. ""This [downward] move was definitely driven by the vast amount of futures being liquidated,"" Viktor Franken, options trader at Orca Traders, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Additionally, it was a weekend, and liquidity was thin during the early Asian hours.""The massive forced closure of longs pushed bitcoin futures into backwardation – a market condition where futures trade at a discount to the spot price. As seen above, bitcoin futures listed on Binance and Kraken traded at a bigger discount than the ones listed on other exchanges, showing the dump mainly happened on Binance and Kraken. ""On Binance, the drop was so bad that you were able to pick up long-term futures at prices well below the spot market,"" Adam Cochran, a partner with Cinneamhain Venture, wrote in a tweet. ""While spot [markets] dipped to $51,000, futures were trading in the low $40,000."" The situation has normalized, with futures drawing higher prices than the spot price.

3845,"The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an editorial for causing “confusion” over its approach to cryptocurrency.Regulators are “creating danger” for retail investors, as exemplified by the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple over its alleged issuance of native currency XRP as an unregistered security, according to the WSJ.The findings in this case “have highlighted the inconsistency of the SEC’s approach,” in not treating bitcoin and ether as securities, for example.Something of a watershed in the case emerged April 7 when Ripple was granted access to the SEC’s internal communications on how it determined whether a crypto is a security.Exemptions had been announced previously for bitcoin and ether by the SEC through statements from former Chairman Jay Clayton, “with no formal rule-making,” according to the editorial.This suggests that the SEC has not set clear rules about which currencies it feels it should regulate and which it does not.See also: Senate Confirms Gary Gensler as Next SEC Chief“This confusion poses risks for investors,” the editorial says, which threatens to derail the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency as represented by Coinbase’s $86 billion public offering last week.",2021-04-19

""It is an alternative investment.""""We believe that encrypted assets [bitcoin and stablecoins] should play a major role in the future either as an investment tool or as an alternative investment.""The price of bitcoin was at $57,031.04, up 2.49% in the past 24 hours, recouping some of the losses incurred over the weekend.  The digital yuan will also not replace the U.S. dollar and that its internationalization was to be a ""natural process"" dependant on market demand, Li said at the same event, according to a report by Bloomberg on Sunday.Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was reportedly troubled by the potential long-term effects a digital yuan could have on the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency.The deputy governor also underscored what he sees as the need for strong regulatory framework by ensuring ""speculative assets"" do not cause substantial financial risk.""If we want such encrypted assets [stablecoins] to become a widely used payment solution we need a stronger regulatory rule, which is more stringent than bitcoin's current regulation,"" said Li.China’s former central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, also attending the forum, agreed with Li, stating that ""everyone has to distinguish between digital assets and digital currencies.""See also: China’s Digital Yuan Is No Threat to US Dollar, Says Bank of Japan Official: Report""Whether it is digital currency or digital assets it should be closely integrated with the real economy and serve the real economy,"" said Zhou.China is currently ahead in the race of major economies developing a central bank digital currency and is planning a major trial of its digital yuan during the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022.",2021-04-19
3847,"After a dramatic week in which the crypto industry’s eyes were on Coinbase’s Nasdaq debut, it’s time to step back and reflect. Plenty of pixels and airtime have already been beamed. Plenty of analysis has been performed about the valuation and growth outlook. But not enough has been said about what I think is the long game.Some have wondered if Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO and co-founder, is “selling out” by going public. A business that was built around an asset group created to eliminate the need for centralized gatekeepers ends up joining the centralized system. How could he?I don’t think Coinbase going public is contradictory at all. Look deeper, and you see a strategic move to influence the system from within.By joining the ranks of listed companies, Coinbase is now part of the traditional financial establishment. Only, it’s not, really.It still is a business premised on assets that do not function like traditional assets, and that permit a level and speed of innovation unlike any before in the financial industry. It is still, through and through, a crypto business.This is more far-reaching than it sounds: It’s not just about providing a platform for the buying and selling of crypto tokens. That’s significant, and currently accounts for 96% of Coinbase’s net revenue. But it’s “just” the on-ramp. It provides a relatively easy way for new investors to take their first steps into crypto – but it won't change traditional markets. Coinbase’s commitment to capital markets reform can be seen in a couple of recent announcements. Earlier this month, Coinbase joined forces with Fidelity, Square and others to form the Crypto Council for Innovation, which will lobby policy makers to support the growing crypto asset industry. A couple of days later, Coinbase announced that it was joining the DeFi Alliance, an organization that supports decentralized finance (DeFi) startups with guidance around regulations and market operations.Institutions are increasingly recognizing that DeFi could impact established processes, but they generally regard it as being too “out there” to be a meaningful threat. Imagine a large cap company actively promoting DeFi services, showing off their advantages and convincing other large cap companies that the operational benefit is worth the risk and the cost.Since money speaks louder than words, let’s look at some of Coinbase’s recent investments.In January, Coinbase acquired Bison Trails, a startup focused on staking services, to expand into the infrastructure-as-a-service segment. This isn’t just any type of infrastructure, though. Staking is based on a new type of consensus protocol, in which the stakeholders of a network (those that hold the assets) vote on transaction validation and other governance issues. In exchange for locking up their ether holdings, stakers earn a yield. In the case of the Beacon chain, Ethereum’s beta transition towards a full proof-of-stake blockchain, this yield can be as much as 11% annually. The Bison Trails acquisition is said to be one of Coinbase’s largest to date, which suggests that they will be looking to leverage this beyond simply offering clients access to yield opportunities. Staking exists as an incentive to actively participate in a network’s governance. The key word here is “incentive.” We saw this week how the median CEO pay in the U.S. jumped 7% to $13.7 million at a time when GDP slumped and unemployment soared. The main reason is that top executive compensation is increasingly linked to stock market performance, which can skew strategic decisions by moving focus to short-term results and superficial investor-appeasing press releases.Imagine the impact of a top-tier listed company showing stakeholders in other industries alternative incentive mechanisms with more balanced rewards and greater involvement in the community.Another area to keep an eye on is Coinbase’s actual and potential investments in tokenized securities. In the S-1 filing, the company said (my emphasis):“Shortly following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, our board of directors will be authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue common stock in one or more series … in the form of blockchain-based tokens.” [emphasis added]This is a powerful and somewhat overlooked statement. The board of directors can do this “without further vote or action” by the company’s stockholders. And bear in mind the company has stakes in several security token platforms and issuers through its venture capital arm Coinbase Ventures.Coinbase is not registered as a broker-dealer or alternative trading system (ATS), so it cannot legally trade securities of any type on its main platform. Its subsidiary Coinbase Capital Markets is an SEC-registered broker-dealer, however, and Coinbase Securities is an SEC-registered ATS, so blockchain-based securities trading could well be on the horizon.Just think of the market buzz if one of Nasdaq’s largest-cap companies issued security tokens, that could trade on its own platform. Nasdaq would effectively be hosting the emergence of a parallel securities market that could end up being significant competition. Talk about changing capital markets from within.And this is the main point: Coinbase did not “sell out.” It took the “revolution” to the castle. On the way, it got its early investors an exit, gave its shareholders liquidity and set the stage for easier and cheaper capital raises going forward.The main takeaway, though, is that crypto market businesses are now in the big leagues. They now have a seat at the traditional capital markets table. This is where the real impact on today’s systems starts.The Senate approved by a 53-45 vote the nomination of Gary Gensler as the new chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). TAKEAWAY: It’s now official, and this is good news as Chairman Gensler understands the crypto industry. He has taught courses on it at MIT, and I have personally heard him speak thoughtfully and knowledgeably about some of its more complicated aspects. There will no doubt be many of these piling up in his in-tray by the time he first sits at his new desk.Brevan Howard Asset Management, the macro investment firm and part-owner of cryptocurrency hedge fund One River Digital, will invest up to 1.5% of its main fund (worth over $5 billion) in crypto assets, according to Bloomberg. TAKEAWAY: Brevan Howard is a well-known name in European hedge fund circles, and was once one of the largest macro hedge funds in the world. Its direct foray into cryptocurrencies is not a surprise, as last October it took a 25% stake in U.S.-based institutional digital asset fund manager One River Digital Asset Management, and co-founder Alan Howard has backed crypto investment firm CoinShares as well as crypto custodian Komainu.Chicago-based Rothschild Investment Corporation recently bought 265,302 shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), and added just under 8,000 shares to its previous Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) holding of 30,454 shares. At current prices, its GBTC holding is worth almost $2.0 million, while its ETHE holding is at $6.3 million. TAKEAWAY: It’s not often we come across institutional asset managers that are more heavily invested in ether than in bitcoin, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see more of this going forward. (For an overview of the different investment cases for bitcoin and ether, download our recent report “Bitcoin + Ether: An Investor’s Perspective”).Purpose Investments and CI Global Asset Management both received approval to launch an ether ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). TAKEAWAY: In early March, Evolve also filed for an ETH ETF, so we could soon see a third. If this happens soon, this would make three BTC and three ETH ETFs in North America – just not in the U.S., the world’s largest ETF market. [TradeBlock, a unit of CoinDesk, is the index provider for Purpose Investments.]Galaxy Digital has filed with the SEC for a bitcoin ETF. TAKEAWAY: For those keeping score, this makes seven bitcoin ETF applications in front of the SEC, with only two currently under active review (VanEck and WisdomTree).Digital asset manager Grayscale Investments (a subsidiary of DCG, also parent of CoinDesk) has taken an equity stake in ETF issuer ClearShares. TAKEAWAY: Details are scarce (for instance, it’s not clear if Grayscale has a minority or a majority stake), but this seems to confirm Grayscale’s commitment to issuing other types of products. Last week it issued a statement expressing its intention to convert its flagship fund to an ETF when that becomes legally possible. Swiss-based METACO, whose clients include several large banks, is building an offering of decentralized finance and staking services for its institutional clients. TAKEAWAY: This is one of several signs we have started seeing recently of growing traditional finance in DeFi, beyond the potential profit in holding the relevant tokens. Decentralized finance may seem like the antithesis of the centralized financial services banks offer, but it appears that some appreciate the potential market expansion and cost reduction enabled by some of these new platforms. Furthermore, we are likely to see a growing interest from banks in staking (the equivalent of mining on proof-of-stake blockchains), as it offers a yield unavailable in mainstream markets.Asset manager WisdomTree Investments has listed its bitcoin ETP on Deutsche Boerse’s Xetra market, under the ticker “WBIT.” TAKEAWAY: We have seen such a wide range of ETPs list on European exchanges so far this year (Ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin cash, polkadot) that it’s almost surprising to see another bitcoin one join the growing ranks.",2021-04-18
3848,"Bitcoin fell sharply on Sunday, dipping well below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) support for the first time in six months.While the decline looks typical of a bull market correction, it could be extended further if prices find acceptance under the 50-day SMA, according to one analyst.""The loss of [bullish] momentum is only short term in nature, but we would view consecutive closes below the 50-day SMA as a reason to move to the sidelines,"" Katie Stockton, technical analyst and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk in an email.Bitcoin is currently trading near $55,150 on Coinbase, having dropped by roughly $8,000 to $52,148 during the Asian daylight hours. The 50-day SMA is located at $56,283.According to Katie, back-to-back daily closes (23:59 UTC) below the SMA support would open the doors for the former resistance-turned-support near $42,000 (January high).The 50-day SMA is one of the most widely-tracked averages along with the 100- and 200-day SMAs. As such, violation of these SMA supports often invites stronger chart-driven selling.Theoretically, the concept of daily close does not apply to crypto markets, as it is functional 24/7, unlike stock markets, which are open only for limited hours during weekdays.However, TradingView and other chart software open the new daily candle at 00:00 UTC, allowing technical analysts to assess the strength/weakness in the market depending on the daily open, high, low, and closing prices.Despite the retreat from record highs seen earlier this week, bitcoin is still up 90% on a year-to-date basis, and the path of least resistance remains to the higher side.""We believe the pullback is counter-trend, rather than the start of a bearish reversal because it follows a confirmed breakout to new highs,"" Stockton said, adding that the cryptocurrency will remain on the hunt for $69,000 even if we see a deeper drawdown below the 50-day SMA.Also read: Spate of Old, Wrong or Dubious ‘News’ Spooks Rookie Investors, Fuels Crypto Selloff",2021-04-18

3850,"Bitcoin’s price rally in the days leading up to Coinbase’s hotly anticipated debut on the Nasdaq this week was largely driven by retail traders eager to get in on the action while whales were happy to take their money and swim away, blockchain data shows.The number of unique addresses holding at least 0.01 coins rose from 8.96 million to over 9 million in the five days to April 14, alongside bitcoin's ascent from $59,000 to a record high of $64,801.79, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The count of addresses with non-zero balance and ones holding least 0.1 coins also rose in tandem with the price. Meanwhile, those with a minimum balance of 1,000 BTC – also known as the ""Rich List"" – dropped from 2,240 to 2,228. The tally of ""whole coiners,"" or addresses with a minimum balance of one coin, fell amid the price rise. ""The pre-Coinbase IPO rally was driven by retail investors, in mass,"" Flex Yang, CEO of Hong Kong-based Babel Finance, said in an email. ""We saw that the continuing decline of whales on the network further indicated that the decentralization of the Bitcoin network was really taking place."" Some readers may argue that the diverging trends in the growth of small and large balance addresses may mearly represent the trend of whales holding coins in several addresses to mitigate hacking risks. A single user can store coins in multiple addresses. Similarly, exchange addresses have coins belonging to more than one individual. However, Glassnode's whale entities metric, which clusters crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 bitcoin to provide a more precise estimate of the actual number of holders, also points to continued liquidation by large traders during the cryptocurrency's move to record highs. The number of whale entities fell to a 3.5-month low of 2,228 on April 14. The metric decoupled from the rising price in February and dropped by 10% to 2,232 seen in the seven weeks to March 31. It shows retail investors' high level of engagement began in the first quarter and continues to the present. Some observers, however, say these charts do not provide sufficient information, leaving the doors open for guesswork. ""The whale entities chart could show that smaller retail investors are purchasing bitcoin, and large holders are selling into that rally,"" Gavin Smith, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Panxora, told CoinDesk in LinkedIn chat. ""It could also be showing that a smaller number of large investors is buying bitcoin, so the large entities' concentration is increasing.""According to Smith, the latter is the case. ""We are seeing some very large investors moving into the market, and their assets are concentrated in a small number of fund and custodial accounts. Retail involvement has been lower this cycle than in 2017,"" Smith said. Also read: Week in Review: Turkey’s Crypto Payments Ban, Morgan Stanley, Coinbase, Markets Check and MoreWhatever the case, the path of least resistance for bitcoin remains on the higher side, as the ""suits [institutions] are here to stay,"" as CoinDesk's research analysts noted in the first quarter review.

The ban would take effect on April 30.“Today's weakness is mostly attributed to accelerated profit taking after news hit that Turkey bans crypto payments,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, told CoinDesk in an email. “The biggest fear for many crypto traders has always been that big governments might impose harsh restrictions on cryptocurrencies.”The profit-taking behavior was also observed in the trading activity where the daily trading volume on eight spot exchanges tracked by CoinDesk went up from the prior day.“The situation in Turkey is rather unique given the government is doing everything in their power to stabilize their currency,” Moya said. “Many on Wall Street believe that the lira is poised to fall over 10% in the short term, and that is forcing Turkey to impose capital controls and now also slow down liras going into bitcoin.”Speaking on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover"" show on Friday, CoinDesk Global Macro Editor Emily Parker said: “Crypto cannot really be stopped. You can make it a lot harder to access, but no government has been able to successfully shut down crypto entirely.”Ether was moving in tandem with bitcoin Friday after logging a new record-high price above $2,500 a day ago in the wake of the Berlin hard fork upgrade implementation.Meanwhile, the star of altcoins on Friday is dogecoin (DOGE), the meme token born as a joke in 2013.At press time, dogecoin was changing hands at $0.35, up 160.67% in the past 24 hours.DOGE’s trading volume is another sign of bullish sentiment around the Shiba Inu-represented cryptocurrency, the most traded cryptocurrency on centralized exchanges in the past 24 hours, according to CryptoCompare. According to IntoTheBlock’s newsletter on Friday, the number of addresses holding dogecoin for less than a month reached a record high in February and continued to go up in both March and April.The U.S.-based crypto exchange giant Coinbase, which went public this week, still has not listed dogecoin, despite the high demand.""With the WallStreetBets and GameStop saga setting a distinct anti-Wall Street tone among retail investors, DOGE, as an almost 'anti-crypto,' seems to have caught many imaginations,” Richard Delaney, senior content writer at OKEx Insights, told CoinDesk, referring to the Reddit forum “Set in this context, heavy promotion from the likes of Elon Musk, Mark Cuban and an army of YouTube and TikTok influencers are fueling the current dogecoin mania.”But as Du Jun, co-founder of another popular crypto exchange, Huobi, warned, there are risks around the beloved meme token. Despite the growing interest from new investors, DOGE holders are still highly concentrated within the top 10 addresses, which counts about 41.35% of all circulating dogecoin.Read More: Coinbase Misses Out on Dogecoin Listing as Meme Token Rallies 6,000%+ on BinanceOther digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the red Friday.

3852,"Austin, Texas-based cryptocurrency mining firm Blockcap mined 544 bitcoin in Q1, an earnings report revealed exclusively to CoinDesk shows. Meanwhile, rival Riot, one of the largest publicly traded miners in North America, mined 491 bitcoin in the same period, per Securities and Exchange Commission filings.Blockcap’s haul follows the company’s $38 million funding round and its acquisition of 32,000 Bitmain ASICs, and Riot’s comes after the miner inked a deal for 49,000 ASICs from Bitmain in the beginning of April.

The United States and Canada now share anywhere from 10%-15% of Bitcoin’s global hashrate, a trend that could continue with investment dollars pouring into North American mining firms.“Blockcap has an aggressive growth strategy that is designed to create more jobs in the blockchain industry not just in the United States but also in our home state of Texas and our hometown of Austin,” Blockcap founder and Chairman Darin Feinstein said. “We believe there is ample room for all of us to expand together and in turn provide broader, sustained economic growth at the local, state and national levels.”An important piece of this growing industry, ASIC manufacturing, just touched down on the continent in the last year with ePIC, an ASIC manufacturer fresh off a $7 million series A funding round.“North America could be a mining powerhouse but three key pieces need to come together for that to happen,” Henry Quan, CEO of ASIC maker ePIC, said. “There’s a lot of cheap energy here, commercial miners and a favorable political climate, so that’s the first thing.

3853,"The price of Coinbase's direct listing must be eye-popping for investors who watch equities closely but haven't spent a lot of time with crypto assets.One equities fundamentals analyst, speaking on CoinDesk TV Thursday, estimated Coinbase's true value at approximately more like $50 per share. (Coinbase closed its first full day of trading at $328.)There are three reasons why investors might be willing to pay a price that represents such a high premium over what Coinbase's fundamentals might seem to command. The first suggests the word ""exchange"" isn’t a good descriptor of Coinbase’s business. The second looks at Coinbase's growth. The third looks at Coinbase as a passive, diversified investment in crypto assets.First, it's important to get away from comparing Coinbase to equities exchanges. Coinbase isn't an ""exchange,"" at least not in the sense that the word is used to describe the Nasdaq or the NYSE.In addition to matching buy and sell orders, Coinbase and other crypto ""exchanges"" operate custodian and prime-brokerage businesses, serving a mixture of retail and institutional clients. Unlike the NYSE or the Nasdaq, these exchanges give retail users direct access to the order book. In the future – through decentralized finance (DeFi), staking and governance protocols – crypto exchanges like Coinbase can be expected to manage a growing portfolio of services related to lending, borrowing, fixed-income and even governance. So, what’s a better analogy? I think it's fair to look at Coinbase as a neobank. But rather than offering a retail banking bundle of services on a new delivery mechanism, crypto exchanges like Coinbase are offering a big-bank bundle of services on a new financial paradigm.Conveniently for this analogy, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs, three of the biggest banks in existence, happened to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday, the same day as Coinbase's listing.The bar graphs don’t lie: When it comes to revenue, Coinbase's $1.8 billion in Q1 2021 is barely visible compared with that of the big banks. This is despite a market cap that, at times on its first day of trading, rivaled the smallest of these, Goldman, which is valued at around $117 billion.But please don't read too much into this chart. It reminds me of something you often hear about hyped tech initial public offerings (IPO): ""They're not even profitable,"" people will say.Nasdaq IPOs are not valued on profit or on revenue, they're valued on growth. They're bought based on an expectation of what will happen next year, not based on what happened last year.The growth chart flips the Coinbase narrative. In this chart, it's Coinbase that looks like the giant while the big banks look diminutive. So even on growth alone you might give Coinbase a premium, keeping in mind, of course, that big growth on small dollars is still small dollars. Coinbase will have to sustain these growth rates for a long time before its revenue will compare to the bulge bracket.To believe that it will, you have to believe Coinbase may be poised to ride a paradigm shift in finance. In that light, a valuation north of $60 billion begins to make more sense. Still, one question any investor should be asking is, will Coinbase simply track the price of bitcoin? In other words, why buy Coinbase when bitcoin is available? The answer is the crypto market tends to vacillate between cycles in which bitcoin is driving momentum and cycles in which alternative coins are driving momentum. Right now it's altcoin season, and some may see Coinbase as a way to spread their bet beyond bitcoin.This chart shows Coinbase's revenue growth each quarter alongside bitcoin's quarterly returns. It's an apples-to-oranges comparison, but it gives a sense of how bitcoin and Coinbase, like bitcoin and altcoins, can trade momentum periods back and forth. There are quarters in which Coinbase revenue growth outpaces bitcoin's price appreciation and vice versa.Coinbase's revenues come from a mix of bitcoin- and altcoin-related drivers. This makes Coinbase, as others have observed and the chart above proves, a diversified investment on the crypto space.Diversified, passive opportunities in crypto are not common. But the category's volatility, complexity and sheer novelty make a passive approach a natural fit. Coinbase's premium is, in part, a signal of investors' desire for such opportunities.",2021-04-16
3854,"Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said bitcoin is a ""store of value"" that's not yet ready for wider adoption as a medium of exchange.  Kaplan, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Harvard Business School professor, made the remarks Friday at a bitcoin conference hosted by Texas A&M University's Mays Business School. He served on the Federal Reserve's monetary-policy committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, before rotating off at the end of 2020.""Right now it's clear it's a store of value,"" Kaplan said of the largest cryptocurrency. ""It obviously moves a lot in value, which could keep it from spreading too far as a medium of exchange and wide adoption, but that can change.""Lately, that movement has been up, in dollar terms. The price of bitcoin (BTC) has increased eightfold over the past year, to about $61,400 as of press time, for a market capitalization of about $1.1 trillion. A growing number of big investors, including legendary hedge fund managers Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller, have said bitcoin might serve as an effective hedge against inflation in the face of trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.An alternative perspective would be that the U.S. dollar has lost nearly 90% of its value, when expressed in bitcoin terms.

3855,"Years from now, we’ll talk about “the period before Coinbase’s listing” and “the period after it.”The raucous arrival of the biggest crypto startup onto Wall Street Wednesday has unleashed an explosion of self-perpetuating interest in the crypto world. Pundits now expect wider adoption, unleashing capital and feeding even more new ideas into the crypto innovation machine. Already, as you’ll see in the “Relevant Reads” section of this week’s newsletter, the buzz is driving another buying frenzy across the crypto markets.That Coinbase buzz sets the tone for both this week’s column – which looks at how the company’s status as a listed company could pose challenges to how easily it can innovate – and for the podcast. For the latter, Sheila Warren and I were joined on the day of Coinbase’s listing by Wall Street Journal reporter (and my co-author) Paul Vigna and CoinDesk Director of Research Noelle Acheson to discuss the myriad ways the Coinbase listing is going to challenge Wall Street and vice versa. Have a listen after reading the newsletter.Coinbase’s Nasdaq listing has unlocked tens of billions of dollars in new wealth for its founders and early investors, but the move comes with a catch: decision-making is now constrained by the higher public scrutiny and quarterly performance expectations all listed companies face.Having just leapt into the ranks of the world’s 100 richest people, CEO Brian Armstrong no doubt believes that’s a price worth paying. He’s probably also looking at the renegade behavior of crypto-friendly CEOs at other public companies, such as Tesla’s Elon Musk and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, and concluding he still has plenty of room to maneuver.But the real issue is that Wall Street’s regulatory and self-regulatory system of reporting and compliance – introduced over decades by both government and self-regulatory bodies to protect the interests of minority shareholders and the general public – is now broken. Relentless monetary expansion, which has indiscriminately boosted all stocks in dollar terms, has reinforced a pre-existing problem where executives are rewarded for short-term share price gains rather than for pursuing long-term growth. When you represent an industry that challenges the status quo of centralized finance, it’s awkward to embrace a corporate system that’s enriching a few at the expense of the many.Executive pay is exhibit A in the failure of the stock market to align corporate actions with the wider interests of the economy and free markets, as the Wall Street Journal recently showed. Surveying 300 companies that had filed 2020 compensation data, it found median CEO pay soared to $13.7 million last year from $12.8 million in 2019, even as COVID-19 fostered the worst recession since the 1930s and millions of Americans lost their jobs, and despite companies responding to that situation by cutting executive packages. (See the chart in the section below.)The reason for this anomaly is simple: the bulk of executive earnings is tied up in stocks and option grants. And thanks to the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented “quantitative easing” (QE) efforts to boost the value of financial assets, share prices skyrocketed last year, with the S&P 500 index gaining 16.26% to close the year at a record high. That performance had little to do with management decisions.  While the thinking was once that stock-based compensation would constructively align management interests with shareholders, a great deal of academic research in recent years has found real flaws in the approach. Both shareholders and employees are harmed by short-termism and the temptation to tap easy quarterly earnings results rather than invest in bigger gains over a longer period. In the case of Enron and other scandals, options-based compensation has even been blamed for encouraging fraud. Yet, the model persists, in part because companies are fearful about retaining talent in a tight market for top-level management recruits. Now, the QE phenomenon is entrenching it even further as it encourages CEOs to stay put, continue with the status quo and let the central bank-led price rally do its magic.There is a sign of pushback from corporate boards, which are not happy about bumping CEOs up on the cap table when, by any other measure, they’re not actually performing very well. A number of companies face more pay reform this year, according to the WSJ report. Coupled with the increasing power of ESG (environment-social-governance) compliance committees at investing institutions, which are already expressing concerns about Bitcoin’s carbon footprint and perhaps about Coinbase’s employee diversity record, the company is entering an environment where its policies and practices will be under greater scrutiny. That’s nothing new, of course. All startups make this adjustment when they go public. But it poses especially interesting questions for Coinbase.To be sure, Armstrong and Co. likely have more leeway than stodgy, established companies to undertake innovation and even to kill profitable business lines to make way for needed change. Much like Musk and Saylor’s bitcoin holdings, his firm’s stash of crypto assets has become a hugely valuable buffer against volatility. And given that widespread crypto adoption is yet to happen among corporate and retail users in a $90 trillion global economy, there is surely plenty of room for even more growth than it is currently reporting. Also, unlike many fast-growth tech companies, Coinbase is already profitable. That trifecta of advantages gives Coinbase’s management more freedom to ignore pressure from institutional shareholders that might otherwise demand changes in corporate strategy. What’s more, because no new money was raised in the Nasdaq listing – it was a direct listing, not an initial public offering – founders and early investors will retain a relatively high level of control over the company. This is not to say there won’t be any pressure. The eyes of the world are on Coinbase now. And if earnings drop during a sustained down period in crypto markets, calls for change could grow. For Coinbase, there’s the added pressure that innovation in the crypto industry is faster paced than just about anywhere. (And, ironically, as I wrote last week, its listing is creating opportunities for others to stoke that innovation fire.)As decentralized exchanges – the alternative model to Coinbase’s central custodian approach – achieve scaling and user experience improvements, the privacy advantages and added capabilities for plugging into the decentralized finance (DeFi) zeitgeist might eventually prove hard for Coinbase to compete with. The company is going to need to be ready to innovate – it must think like Netflix, not Blockbuster. There are reasons to believe Coinbase will be up to the challenge. It now has massive fundraising capability and an ever-growing war chest with which to make useful acquisitions. It can hire the smartest crypto guys in the room.But going head to head with big, open-source, decentralized communities of unencumbered, genius crypto developers is harder to do when you’re constantly having to explain yourself to the Wall Street suits.To put that CEO pay increase into context, let’s compare two charts. The first is lifted from the Wall Street Journal’s article on the topic. (With a credit going to WSJ’s own source on those numbers, MyLogIQ). It shows that, apart from a dip in 2011, median CEO pay among the 300-strong sample of S&P 500 companies has increased sharply over the past decade. In fact, it has almost doubled since that dip in the first year. And, as mentioned above, it rose another 7% during last year’s recession.The second chart is from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED database. It shows 10 years of median weekly earnings for the U.S. economy reported on a quarterly basis. (We only have the first three quarters of data for 2020.)Usually, economists address median wages in real, inflation-adjusted terms to capture the true purchasing power of workers. However, the CEO pay data was expressed in current dollars, so we used a similar non-adjusted number for this FRED chart.The first takeaway is that, notwithstanding a modest acceleration in the last two years of the Trump Administration, wage earnings have grown much more slowly than CEO pay, rising 33% from third quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of last year. (Based on a separate, inflation-adjusted dataset from FRED, the gain was just 12% in real terms.)The other is that between the second quarter and third quarter of last year, in the midst of the recession, wages fell. The contrast with CEOs is stark. Wage earners don’t have the same exposure as wealthier people to stocks and other financial assets that were bolstered by the liquidity expansion – and they certainly don’t have their income determined by them.Also, setting aside comparative percentage increases, consider the proportionality. Ideally we’d have superimposed annualized median wage numbers onto the CEO pay chart, but the tiny bars at the bottom would have been barely discernible.Simplistic, knee-jerk apologies for this glaring inequity typically say, well, this is the market at work. CEO talent is clearly worth it. A better approach is to look at this through the lens of decentralization: This is a direct outcome of Wall Street’s central gatekeeping place in the U.S. economy, a centrality that creates massive distortions and misaligned incentives. In fact, it undermines the free market. This is what crypto, with its peer-to-peer value transfer system, was supposed to try to fix. The other big news Wednesday might seem tangential but was totally relevant to Coinbase’s listing: Gary Gensler’s confirmation as Securities and Exchange Commission chair.  The crypto community has keenly anticipated the arrival of Gensler, whose MIT blockchain teaching experience makes him the best-crypto-informed U.S. regulatory chief ever. People are hoping for clarity on outstanding matters such as a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, the SEC’s position toward DeFi’s decentralized exchanges and some definitive guidance on tokens as securities.The confirmation was expected but the commentary around it was telling for what it says about how many different vested interests are vying for Gensler’s attention. Take this rather obligatory statement from the other SEC commissioners, published in two tweets by the SEC’s communications department. What was interesting was the barrage of “XRP Army” replies calling on Gensler to drop the SEC’s lawsuit alleging Ripple sold XRP as an unlawful security. Wishful thinking, I’d say, given that in 2018 Gensler said he thought XRP was a “noncompliant security.”Then there was this tweet from U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis from the blockchain-friendly state of Wyoming, who is a big proponent of U.S. regulatory agencies taking a more innovation-friendly approach toward the technology. She ties the argument back to a key concern of the Biden Administration: competing with China in technology, in this case in digital currencies.Less polite was Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, whose comments are shown here via a tweet from CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De. Toomey voted against Gensler’s appointment, citing fears of a “social liberal agenda.” That may hint at a future battle as institutions involved in ESG investments look to the SEC to take a stance on accounting standards in that field.Riding on the Coinbase buzz, the entire crypto market burst to life this past week, with multiple tokens within the CoinDesk 20 hitting all-time highs and/or posting record- or near-record weekly gains. Not everyone thinks that’s a good thing.",2021-04-16

3857,"Disruptions in coal plants in Xinjiang and other parts of China have knocked out bitcoin miners in the region, clipping as much as 35 exahashes from the Bitcoin system’s global hashrate, CoinDesk has learned.At the time of publication, Figures shared with CoinDesk show that the top 7 Bitcoin mining pools lost, on average, 16.5% of their hash rate as a result of the incident. Primitive Ventures partner Dovey Wan, who operates mining equipment in one of the regions, told CoinDesk the coal-fired plants are down after “a massive explosion under the plants.”The coal plant shutdowns follow coal mine accidents in Shanxi, Xinjiang and Guizhou provinces, which collectively have left nearly a dozen dead and, in the case of the mine in Xinjian, 21 people trapped. Coal-abundant Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia are popular spots for Chinese bitcoin miners in the autumn and winter, when the rains that usually supply cheap hydro energy in regions like Sichuan are low.The incident highlights how much of bitcoin mining is still confined to China, but given Bitcoin’s design, it should only cause minor delays for Bitcoin block times for the next couple of weeks (if at all).Bitcoin’s hashrate is a lagging indicator that measures the collective energy input and work output of the network. The self-reported hashrate of all mining pools is currently around 128 exahashes per second, according to mining pool APIs, down from 165 exahashes for the Bitcoin network’s seven-day moving average.Luxor Mining CFO Ethan Vera said the outages currently have “no effect on the profitability of miners,” but that we would see the ramifications of this event during Bitcoin’s next difficulty adjustment, which could happen later than expected on May 1, Vera said. He expects Bitcoin’s difficulty to drop in response to the slower block times the network will experience with these miners offline.Hashrate is a metric for gauging the amount of power being used to mine bitcoin. Consequently, Bitcoin’s difficulty, a self-contained score that deems how easy or hard it is to mine bitcoin based on how much hashrate is on the network, hit another all-time high yesterday. “Network difficulty adjusted yesterday, so the next adjustment is not scheduled for another 14 days,” Vera explained. “If the hashrate [in Xinjiang] remains offline, it means we will find blocks less frequently than the target (every 10 min) and that will have some downward pressure on next difficulty adjustment. So it really depends on how long this outage lasts to determine how big of an impact it will have on mining profitability,” said Vera.A miner who spoke to The Block estimated the mining farms in the region “should resume in about a week from now.”Updated April 19, 2021, 14:04 UTC: This article was updated to clarify data regarding what percentage of hash rate from major mining pools went offline .",2021-04-16
3858,"To those of us who have been in the industry for a long time, Dogecoin has always been an oddity: A project that has exceptional approachability and appeal to new users while lacking most of the characteristics that make cryptocurrencies useful or valuable.Created in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, the project was abandoned years ago by its founders and developers, if not its fans. Until recently, it was in such a weak state that it couldn’t even power its own blockchain infrastructure and in 2014 hitched its proverbial wagon to another early cryptocurrency called litecoin.At the time, that seemed like a necessary move – there were questions about whether DOGE could survive at all. Then, yesterday, the top meme token eclipsed its patron chain.For the moment at least, dogecoin is more than double the size of litecoin (and 330-year-old Barclays bank as well) when measured by market capitalization.So what on Earth is happening here?A couple of years ago, I did a series of interviews with people in Iran, India, Singapore, Honduras, Nigeria and a couple of other places. I went in assuming that bitcoin would not be the token of choice because the transaction fees are, in many cases, higher than a day’s wage and just generally are out of whack with the value scales locally.I learned that, although that was true, people still saw bitcoin as their best option, which created a self-reinforcing cycle, the implications of which we’re still watching play out today.Those decisions are driven by a simple question: Of all the currencies to which I have access, which one is most likely to be useful to me?For bitcoin, that utility comes in two flavors. One is predictability. People turn their local currencies into bitcoin because they are looking for a way to store value that’s disconnected from local political and economic realities. Everyone knows about bitcoin’s fixed token supply as well as its largely unchangeable monetary policy, making it out of reach for governments broadly.The other reason, which may be even more important, is liquidity. People want to be sure that when they decide to sell there will always be someone there who wants to buy at the market price.So, even though in local terms bitcoin can be viewed as quite expensive, it is the consensus option. People can and do choose to buy other tokens, but this “long tail” of crypto investing is incredibly, and increasingly, diverse as the number of tokens to pick from expands. They’re more speculative because there is little or no consensus. That could change but the so-called first mover advantage and the network effect that bitcoin carries with it has been incredibly powerful. To put it simply, bitcoin is so useful because it’s what everybody uses.For most of this year, I’ve increasingly come to believe that dogecoin is acting like that now. Just as bitcoin is the consensus pick for people looking for “predictable moneyness” in their currency, dogecoin is looking like the consensus pick for people who want “meme-y wackiness” in their currency.That certainly seems to be the case among the Elon Musks, Slim Jims and Mark Cubans of the world, not to mention a growing share of meme culture broadly.See also: Dogecoin No Longer Pup After Tripling Past $50B, Exceeding UK Bank BarclaysThis was highlighted on Conagra Brands’ corporate earnings call earlier this week. Conagra is not a hip company. It owns a formidable basket of old-world brands including Slim Jim (smoked meat sticks), Marie Callender's (a restaurant chain where I ate at once or twice in the 1990s) and Hunt's Tomatoes (my mother’s favorite) along with more than a dozen others.But when it came time to talk about recent wins, Conagra’s CEO highlighted his team’s “dogecoin engagement strategy” as key. Dogecoin has helped double Slim Jim’s Twitter followers, boosting engagement by more than 500%. Sean Connolly, the CEO, credited the dogecoin community with “playing a large part” in delivering Slim Jim the ultimate win in Adweek’s March Madness-themed brand face-off earlier this month.Doge has become the joke currency to beat. Everybody wants to be in on the joke, which pushes up the price, which makes the joke even bigger. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle. Sort of like bitcoin but for the luls.Now, this could all end very badly: Lots of people buying DOGE at these prices don’t know the true story. As they say, easy come, easy go. But at least for now it sure looks like dogecoin is the gold standard of joke currencies, and maybe that’s just enough.",2021-04-16
3859,"Coinbase, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange that went public this week with a direct listing of its shares on Nasdaq, is missing out on the latest frenzy whipping up gasps and chortles in digital asset markets: a ferocious rally in dogecoin that has pushed returns on the doggy-faced meme token to more than 6,000% for the year to date.And it's not just the price inducing the saliva. DOGE, a digital token that was launched as a joke in 2013, has boasted an astonishingly high daily trading volume, exceeding even that of ether, the native token of the popular Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest cryptocurrency overall after bitcoin. Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) has not given any hints that it would list dogecoin. “Although DOGE is not available to trade, you can add it to your watchlist, read news and more with a Coinbase account,” according to a page on the exchange's website. Press officials with the company didn't immediately reply to requests for comment. New shareholders of Coinbase might wonder, however, about the competitive disadvantage given that some of the exchange's biggest global rivals have listed DOGE and appear to be lapping up the sudden spike in trading. According to the website CoinGecko, most of the trading volume in dogecoin in the past 24 hours has come from the big exchanges Binance, OKEx and Huobi. ""OKEx listed DOGE back in 2019 after determining that there was robust public demand for the asset, despite the fact that it's a 'meme coin,'"" an OKEx press representative told CoinDesk. ""DOGE is one of the oldest crypto assets out there and has a strong community supporting it.""A Binance representative declined to comment on why the exchange listed DOGE. ""We really feel the passion from fans of blockchain and cryptocurrency towards dogecoin,"" Huobi co-founder Du Jun told CoinDesk, in a comment forwarded by a press representative via the messaging app WeChat. ""Dogecoin has evolved from a pure meme token to a very special pop culture phenomenon.""The representative added a statement of caution, however, that dogecoin has historically held little appeal as a promising blockchain project. ""We also want to warn our users that the project behind dogecoin almost has had zero technology breakthroughs, and the DOGE holders are highly concentrated,"" Du said. ""The top 10 dogecoin addresses hold about 41.35% of all circulating dogecoin. This means that a small number of the dogecoin investors have power over prices and investors should be cautious as they get into dogecoin."" Some DOGE lovers have asked whether the token might get an even bigger price pump if it gets listed on Coinbase. Analysts for the cryptocurrency data firm Messari recently wrote that tokens experience an average 91% return in their first five days after a listing on the U.S. exchange.  ""WHAT IF coinbase were to add #dogecoin on 4/20???"" the Twitter user @yaybitcoin wrote Friday. This isn't the first time posters across social media have questioned Coinbase's seeming unwillingness to make dogecoin trading available.None other than Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has spoken adoringly of dogecoin, wrote on Twitter in March that he also wants Coinbase to allow the Shiba Inu-represented cryptocurrency on its platform.Dogecoin has also received endorsement from entrepreneurs including billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks, which recently announced it would accept the token as payment for game tickets and merchandise.As of press time, dogecoin was trading at $0.33, more than doubling in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20. It's now the sixth-most valuable cryptocurrency in the world, passing cardano, polkadot and uniswap, per Messari data.Dogecoin's market capitalization, at roughly $43 billion, is on par with that of the giant U.K. bank Barclays, which traces its history back to the 18th century.

3860,"Coinbase on Wall Street is widely seen as validating bitcoin, but a lot of bitcoiners aren't feeling validated. Why are so many hardcore bitcoiners so disgruntled?Well, as others have pointed out, Coinbase just isn’t all that punk rock. The cypherpunk movement from which Bitcoin sprang advocated for privacy and self-empowerment in face of meddling governments and corporations. A centralized exchange – even one responsible for onboarding tens of millions of people into the revolution – is just another intermediary. (And an expensive one at that: 97% of Coinbase's revenues come from transaction fees that are above industry averages.)“The fact that a company like Coinbase went public makes it clear that custodial solutions have product-market fit and, honestly, it’s sad,” perennial nomad and Bitcoin promoter Katie Ananina said in a direct message. If punks chant “Oy,” bitcoiners rally around “not your keys, not your coins,” a reminder that “radical ownership” only comes from taking possession of your money.In a similar vein, Coinbase’s public listing solidifies the exchange’s place among the Silicon Valley and Wall Street set. For some, the exchange’s “mission-focused” attitude towards crypto adoption is an artifice. So, asking bitcoiners whether they like Coinbase is like asking crust-punks whether they like Johnny Rotten.Prominent Bitcoin personality Brekkie von Bitcoin says he bought his first BTC from the exchange but thinks Coinbase “has lost the thread.” Perhaps most glaring is that the Silicon Valley-based company has signed surveillance contracts with the government. “They used to be revolutionary,” he said.Then there’s the exchange’s poly-crypto approach to the industry. Von Bitcoin admits Coinbase was a needed agonist for bitcoin but it’s guilty of “promoting every altcoin under the sun.” New users might confuse various altcoins for cheaper versions of BTC, a sort of identity theft.Nowhere is this more apparent than in Coinbase’s willingness to list bitcoin forks. Investor Stephen Cole went as far as saying “Coinbase attacked Bitcoin” by supporting competing, payments-friendly versions – “BitcoinXT. Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Cash.” – of the original cryptocurrency.Some are turned off for less ideological reasons, namely Coinbase’s history of going down during market rallies and higher-than-average trading fees. Not to mention the perennial complaints of lackluster customer support.Bitcoiners are a strong-willed, vocal bunch. But even their calls to blacklist the exchange might be drowned out by traders barking for the exchange to list dogecoin.",2021-04-16

3862,"When Paris Hilton goes to sleep, she dreams about non-fungible tokens. Actual dreams. Literal dreams. She dreams about NFT projects, NFT artists, even NFT metaverses. “NFTs have literally taken over my entire mind and soul,” she tells me. “I’m obsessed. It’s all I think about. I've never been so excited about something in my life because I really see this as the future. I'm just so obsessed with it that I actually have dreams about it every single night.”Let’s back up. To those just tuning in, it might seem Hilton has a sudden, or even suspicious, passion for NFTs – the latest celebrity to hop on the (lucrative) bandwagon.  The reality? She’s been here all along. We just didn’t notice. “I’ve been into crypto forever,” she tells me in our hour-long call, explaining that her interest was sparked by a dinner she had with some Ethereum founders back in 2016. Over four years ago. This was before the 2017 hype cycle. This was before most people had heard of Vitalik Buterin. Hilton says she invested in both bitcoin and ether in 2016, back when BTC was valued below $1,000 (today it’s over $60K) and ETH below $10 (today it’s over $2,000). That’s hot.Now, finally, Hilton is letting her Crypto Flag fly. On National Pet Day she introduced her two newest adorable pets – “Crypto Hilton” and “Ether Reum,” with Ether sharing a last name with both the blockchain protocol and her fiancé, Carter Reum. “Their names are an ode to my passion and love for #NFTs,” she tweeted. She created an NFT-focused Instagram account. She added laser eyes to her Twitter avatar – the bitcoin bulls’ symbol of solidarity.  This earned her a salute from bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor: “Welcome to the team, Paris Hilton.” It’s hard to overstate her championing of NFTs. If some kind of AI algorithm analyzed the current Twitter feed of Paris Hilton – and didn’t know her face, name, or reputation – it would conclude that she’s a regular crypto junkie or even an NFT fan-girl. “This is seriously the cutest and most soothing thing to look at and listen to! Love this piece by @Friendswithyou @Diplo,” she gushed the other day. She tweets out love to @fewocious, the 18-year-old NFT artist prodigy. She banters with Pak, nudging Sotheby’s to speculate about a collaboration. She’s a regular at Clubhouse NFT, she does NFT Discords and she explores digital art galleries.And she’s quickly winning over skeptics. “She came in and she started talking to everybody,” says CryptoYuna, a longtime crypto artist. Yuna was amazed Hilton not only followed her on Twitter but engaged in DMs and seemed genuinely curious about her work. “I think she’s changed everybody’s perception of her in the space,” says Yuna, who even made her an honorary “Graffiti Queen,” in recognition of her support for female NFT artists. (Yuna adds that some other celebrities, in contrast, just dipped into the NFT space to make a quick buck.) “I think she’s done a damn good job,” says another NFT artist, Josie Bellini. “She’s going on podcasts. She’s learning. That’s cool to me.” She quickly gained the respect of one of the space’s most influential collectors, Whale Shark, who is now both her friend and NFT sherpa. This weekend (April 17), Paris Hilton is launching her first NFT drop on Nifty Gateway, for which she has collaborated with Blake Kathryn, an acclaimed digital artist. (The Verge once described Kathryn’s 3D dreamscapes as having the power “to transport viewers to another world – one of rich color palettes, glossy androids, and a neon-hued alternate reality.”) But she spends more time promoting other NFT artists than her own drop, constantly shining the spotlight (and 16.9 million Twitter followers) on emerging NFT artists.  Hilton wants to bring NFTs to the masses – and she has the clout to do it, or at least make a noble effort. “I see myself as a public figure with a large platform who can shepherd this technology into the mainstream,” she says. “And I do this to help empower people, especially creators, to uplift voices, especially females, and eventually change the world for the better.” She’s done her homework. In a recent post on ParisHilton.com, she wrote an NFT explainer that’s about as lucid as any in the space, noting that NFTs are democratizing art, changing the fashion industry, enabling the metaverse (a low-key passion of hers for years) and letting creators directly engage with fans. It’s an excellent NFT primer. In short, she gets it. (The only downside: In crushing personal news, this means that Paris Hilton is not only a better DJ, socialite, influencer, business person and fashion icon than me, but also a better writer of NFT explainers. Truly crushing.)If all this looks out of character, maybe it’s because we never truly understood her actual character. “I’ve always been an undercover nerd,” she tells me. She even gave us clues of this before but we ignored them, distracted by her reputation and the pink bubbles. “I’m obsessed with gadgets,” she told W magazine back in 2017. “I could do VR [virtual reality] for hours; it’s so sick. When you put it on, it’s like you’re in another world. And when you take it off, it’s weird to be back in reality.” Her enthusiasm for NFTs seems to be the latest chapter, or perhaps the culmination, of her journey to show her true colors. In September, in her documentary “This is Paris,” she revealed that since the early 2000s she was “playing a character” as a survival mechanism from earlier trauma, suffered in a Utah boarding school. “When I look around my life, it’s like a cartoon,” she says towards the end of the documentary, in a wrenching moment of vulnerability. “I’ve created this fantasy world cartoon.” She has now stepped out of that cartoon, she’s comfortable showing her substance and this new world of hers is one filled with NFTs.The truth is that Paris Hilton is often ahead of the times. I’ve long argued that she invented the selfie. (Full disclosure: We met a few years ago and had a good laugh over her selfie innovation.) Some call her the “original influencer.” She invented the social media star. So why shouldn’t she be at the forefront of NFTs, which are all about media and innovation?There are even some parallels between the arc of Paris Hilton and the arc of NFTs. Hilton, of course, was originally known as “famous for being famous.” Bitcoin and NFTs, in a sense, have value because people think they have value. And the more people learn about both Paris and crypto, they tend to shed those earlier (and misinformed) impressions, open their minds and appreciate the underlying substance. Maybe Paris Hilton is even, sort of … the perfect NFT ambassador? At the start of her documentary, in a recording studio, Paris does a few takes of saying, “This is Paris.” She says it again: “This is Paris Hilton.” A third time: “This is Paris Hilton.” A fourth, a fifth. Each time her voice is different. One of her takes is coquettish, one is sexy, one is serious. It’s a good scene. It shows her range, her self-awareness and it hints at a complexity we’ve missed all along. So in the spirit of that opener… This…Is…Crypto Paris. Okay, the obvious question: so how’d you get into NFTs?Paris Hilton:  Well, I've always aimed to be an innovator. So last year I was approached to do an NFT for a good cause, so I immediately said yes. Cryptograph said [it was] doing a charity initiative, and I could basically draw whatever I wanted on an iPad. And I chose to draw my kitten, Munchkin. And now I heard that it won the NFT Charity Award.  It's exciting to have done that back in March 2020 and now NFTs are what everyone is talking about. I’ve always loved being a first at things. It makes me proud.What's funny is the Munchkin NFT sold for around $17,000, which seemed crazy at the time but now, given recent NFT price tags in the millions, it feels like a bargain, right?Yeah, I can't even imagine what it's worth now.That first NFT seemed like a fun experiment, for a good cause. But you weren’t deep into NFTs back then. What changed? After I released my digital painting, I realized the power of this technology and how it could empower and inspire people, especially creators. Then I decided that I really wanted to learn, to be a student of the game. I started speaking with industry leaders, joining Clubhouse chats.I feel like NFTs are really a natural extension of what I've always been about – expressing myself boldly, with color and style, but now in a new medium that has the potential to change the world. I realized how it bridges my interests in fashion, visual art, empowering voices and pushing boundaries in media and technology. So I decided it was an important space to learn about and I've been studying it ever since. I’ve been obsessed.When you say “change the world,” what do you mean specifically?Like I wrote in my article in parishilton.com, I think NFTs are the future because it gives power back to the creators. And they make it much easier, and less intimidating, for the everyday collector. It's going to disrupt traditional spaces in art, music and collectibles.I love that with NFTs and the rise of digital art, talented creators have a greater likelihood of being discovered, because it gets rid of the gatekeepers, whether it’s the art gallery or record label. It gives the creator better economics. We're definitely living in the golden age of the creator, so I can't wait to see what the future holds. “Golden age of the creator.” Nice. This is really the future, and all the power is now in the creator’s hands. Even after something sells, creators are still going to be able to profit off that [through royalties programmed into the blockchain], which is amazing for artists because the whole idea of “starving artist” shouldn’t be the case. And I feel like NFTs are going to be the end of that. Which is amazing, because artists are people who bring so much beauty to life. Especially digital artists – they didn't get the respect they deserved, and now they finally are. And I see this type of art as the future. When everything is going digital, why not art?Now people are doing digital art shows, and art galleries, in metaverses like Decentraland. It’s really cool. And with Art Basel coming up, it's going to be very exciting to see all the digital art that's coming out. Today, I actually just ordered some display frames where you can put digital art up in your home, which I think is so cool.Oh wow, digital art in your real-life home? Very cool. Yeah, I feel like it's ""The Jetsons."" When I was little I loved that cartoon and now I kind of feel “The Jetsons” vibes. Amazing. Now I want one of those frames. I’ll send it to you. It’s really cool.You’ve talked before about the power of NFTs for “democratizing art.” Can you elaborate a bit?For so long it's always been about the art galleries. Not everyone can get into the art gallery, and not everyone could get into Art Basel. Now it’s just a whole new world where anybody with talent can make it through. That's how I describe it to people, but I hope when they read this article they'll understand more.You and me both! So when I spoke with Whale Shark, he told me that you’ve really done your homework and were committed to understanding the nuance of NFTs. How’d you get up to speed? Whale Shark has been my mentor, and he’s just so brilliant and so kind. We're on WhatsApp on a daily basis and then we do Zooms every weekend. I’ve learned so much from him and also doing Zooms with people like Kim Dotcom, Josh Fraser and Matthew Liu, who are the founders of Origin Protocol, and the RTFKT Studio guys and the CryptoMotors guys. And Tim Kang, the illustrator, who came over to my house last weekend. He’s just amazing and I’m excited with what he's doing. I've really become close with all of these people in the space. So I learn more every single day, and have really just spent the past couple of months sitting back and listening and learning all there is to learn, and just being fascinated by this whole new world – where the possibilities are endless. And whenever I do something, I want to do it right. I always believe that the best way to do that is to lean in and learn a ton about it and then just be a student of the game.It’s clear you take engaging with the NFT community seriously and are often following NFT artists on Twitter, even if they don’t have a “platform” or very many followers. What has this been like for you? I love this community. I've met so many interesting, kind, creative and cool people. And, yeah, just like you said, I don’t care about followers. There [are] some people I’m following now that have, like, eight followers. It’s not about followers to me at all. It's just about the person. I've never used Twitter so much in my life. [Laughs.] And now it’s the platform I’m using most – that and Clubhouse – because the whole community is on there. Who are some of the artists you’re into? Some of my favorite artists are Blake Kathryn [her NFT collaborator], of course, Pak, FEWOCiOUS, RTFKT Studios, Pranksy, Beeple, 3lau, Steve Aoki, Grimes, Josie Bellini, Josh Pierce, Marius Sperlich, Brendan Dawes, FriendsWithYou, Tom Yoo, and many, many more. You and Pak seem to be tweeting a bunch, and Sotheby’s even teased a collaboration?I think Pak is just this mysterious OG, legend, genius, and what he's doing right now with Sotheby's and Nifty Gateway is revolutionary. And, yes, we have been talking, so maybe you'll be seeing a collaboration in the future, which would be epic.But those are just some of my favorites, and I’m loving it. I wish that I could have them all over to my house because they're so cool. Maybe I will one day, too. I've always been an undercover nerd, so I feel like I'm with my people, finally.I have a sense that you’ve been into tech for longer than people realize.I've always been obsessed with technology. I've always been a tomboy as well, and I've always loved video games. When I did my movie, “The American Meme,” which we shot back in, like, 2016 or 2017, I was already creating this whole virtual reality where people could come and watch me DJ, and be in – basically a metaverse – and be able to wear what they want and bring their friends and dancing and talking. That’s what everyone is doing right now [in the metaverse]. It’s crazy to see that people are actually doing what I said years ago.What do you see people doing in the metaverse? What excites you about it? People could do anything in there. Going to a club to go dancing, or going to an art gallery, or playing sports, or going on a virtual date, or listening to a concert where a DJ is performing – with people from all around the world dancing and everyone can have their own type of avatar and show their NFT art and wear their NFT fashion. I'm excited about it. Like, I love what RTFKT Studios is doing, where they just did the virtual sneaker launch and it sold for $3 million.So I could see other brands coming in. I think that'd be so cool, to have a digital Chanel purse and different dresses. I could see a lot of amazing collaborations between artists and these huge name brands. That would be incredible. Like, I love what FEWOCiOUS is doing. I think he's so cute and sweet. And we just recently became friends, and I found a tweet that he wrote me back in, like, 2018 or something, that I tweeted out the other day. We were both laughing about it. But, yeah, I think a lot of these huge designers are going to want to collab with these artists, and do digital products.You’re kind of perfectly positioned to make that work, right? Have you started putting together deals and partnerships with fashion brands? Yeah, I have 19 product lines myself. I just released my 29th fragrance. I make shoes and clothing and handbags and sunglasses and basically every type of product you can imagine. So for those type of products I'll be doing Paris Hilton products, but it would also be fun to do collaborations with other designers. Super smart to get in on the ground floor.  So, since you said earlier that you’ve always been this “closet nerd” ... –Undercover nerd!Undercover nerd, thank you! [Both laugh.] Are you having fun now revealing this side of you to the world?Definitely. It feels amazing to finally be able to be myself, because for so long in my career I had to play a character. I built this character on this kind of … bubblehead blonde, acting like I didn't know anything and just playing into that dumb blonde stereotype, which was never me at all. It was kind of this show that I created because I had been through so many traumatic experiences that it was kind of something that I felt protected by.But then after doing my documentary, ""This Is Paris,"" and being vulnerable and talking about so many things that have happened, I now feel that I can be my true self. And part of that self is the undercover nerd in me. And I'm proud to show that I’m actually smart and I do know what's going on. And it makes me feel proud that people are starting to see that and to realize that, and that I'm finally getting the credit that I deserve.What can you tell us about how you prepared for your upcoming NFT drop? It’s with Blake Kathryn, who is amazing. I've been a fan of hers for a very long time. I loved her work, so I'm excited to just be collaborating with her. And I want to empower female artists, so that was a huge drive as well. What’s the collaboration process like?I think a lot of people don't realize just how involved and hands-on I am. I first started with just looking at her work, and then I created four mood boards to show her my vision. And from there we started our collaboration process and I put that on parishilton.com so anyone can go check that out. We worked really closely together, doing Zooms every few days. We're both LA-based, so she was able to come over to my house here in [Los Angeles], and we got to work together face to face.Today, like, two hours ago, I got the final pieces and they are incredible. I’m so proud of this collaboration. It's everything I've dreamed of and more. And each piece really has a personal story to it that relates to my life. I think it's amazing that my fans – and whoever wants to collect these – are really going to have a piece of me. When I spoke with Whale Shark, he talked about the importance of good NFTs being smart about leveraging the technology and possibilities for innovation, as opposed to just lazily using a 2D image. How did you think about that during the process? To make sure you weren’t just taking a photo of your elbow and saying, “Here’s my elbow!” Yeah, I know what you mean. I definitely didn't want to just do that. I think that's very lazy when people do something like that, and that's just not what this is about. I'm doing this because I really love to empower creators and I really want to bring this mainstream. And I've worked so hard. I've built an empire myself. This is not about money for me. Like, I'm good either way. So, for me, that is something that's super important. For every drop, that's how it has to be. I want the bar to be raised and for people to know that you need high-quality work. It can't just be a photo of yourself, which I've seen some people do. And that just doesn't work.What do you see as your role in the NFT space?I see myself as a public figure with a large platform who can shepherd this technology into the mainstream. And I do this to help empower people, especially creators, to uplift voices, especially females, and eventually change the world for the better.How do you see NFT empowering female creators?In the next couple of days, I'm going to be announcing something specifically to empower female creators and give back to the community. It's important to encourage and empower more women to join this movement. I'm hoping to lead by example, as I've always been a strong female in male-dominated industries like business and DJ-ing. So I try to pave the way for others, and I think with NFTs it's leveling the playing field for both the creators and collectors. It's going to open the door to more female creators. It's just going to make it easier for people when they have talent to come in. And the best creators are going to get the recognition they deserve, especially with there being no more gatekeepers. It's going to be a whole new world, and it's amazing to see so many females in the space right now.Of course there are skeptics out there who might roll their eyes and say, “This is just another celebrity trying for a cash grab.” And with you, it might even be a double-whammy of skepticism, as people are both skeptical about NFTs and maybe also about you, personally – especially if they only know the old “character.” How do you deal with that skepticism?If I was worried about all the skeptics over the course of my life I wouldn't be anywhere. I consider myself to be gentle, shy and reserved, but I'm also a very strong woman. So after so many years I've built such a thick skin. I always just ignore the haters. I don't care what they say. I focus, I do my homework, I run my media machine and the results speak for themselves. So I'm not worried about skeptics at all because something I've always loved to do is prove people wrong.Let’s talk a little bitcoin before we wrap up. It must be said, you have the best Laser Eyes on the internet. You’ve won that award, and it’s not really up for debate. [Laughs] Thank you.So what got you into bitcoin?Well, I actually had dinner with the founders of Ethereum back in 2016. And since that dinner I was fascinated, and I invested in ethereum and bitcoin and other digital currencies because I just saw them as the future. I just think it makes so much sense. Everything is going digital so currencies are as well. And also my fiancé [Carter Reum] has his VC firm, M13. And they invest in the space. They’re investors in technologies like Lightning Labs. So we're always just comparing notes and talking about it. And now that I'm immersing myself in NFTs I'm just paying even more attention to all of it. But I've been involved in the crypto world since 2016, so it's been a while.Wait, Paris, did I hear you right, that you invested in both ethereum and bitcoin in 2016?Yes.Incredible. Well, the joke's on them.I'm the real OG.I can only imagine your price point ... Yeah, I got in at a really good time. Just like me, always being a pioneer and getting in early. But, yeah, I think it's just amazing. It's proven to be a technology that has longevity, and I feel the same way about NFTs that I do cryptocurrencies. Okay, so here’s a theory of mine. And bear with me for a second. It almost seems like there’s an analogy with you and NFTs. Because at first you were dismissed in many ways because of the “character” you played, and maybe not taken as seriously as you should have been. But obviously you have substance beneath that, which people learn over time. And then take NFTs. When people first hear about NFTs they’re, like, “this isn’t real, this is silly.” But then the more people learn about NFTs they’re, like, “Wait. There’s some legit, industry-changing, maybe world-changing tech and ideas here.” It’s almost like you’re the perfect ambassador for NFTs because you've personally undergone this same journey of being initially dismissed and then people realizing, “Oh, there’s substance.” Yeah, I can agree with that. [Laughs.] I can really relate to NFTs. That's a really funny analogy but it's actually very true.Anything else you want to add?NFTs have literally taken over my entire mind and soul. I’m obsessed. It’s all I think about. I've never been so excited about something in my life because I really see this as the future. I'm just so obsessed with it that I actually have dreams about it every single night. You literally dream about NFTs? Like, WhaleShark is in my dreams as his avatar. All these different characters are in my dreams. I'm in an NFT world and metaverses. It's so weird how it's taken over my whole mind because I used to have severe nightmares from having post-traumatic stress disorder from, you know, all the abuse that I went through at those schools when I was a teenager. So now to have these beautiful dreams of this metaverse and this future and this art – it’s just so amazing and healing for me. Art heals people. It heals me. It always has. And ever since I was a little girl, I've been an artist. And especially with what I've [gone] through, art has been so healing and my pieces in my NiftyGateway drop are very healing, and have to do with what I went through. They're very personal.This has taken over my whole mind and my dreams, and I love it.I'm happy for you. Thanks for your time, Paris. I’ve enjoyed this.I had so much fun talking, and I look forward to speaking again soon. Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.",2021-04-16
3863,Options data shows traders' bullish conviction on bitcoin has strengthened with the cryptocurrency's positive performance in the first half of April.Also read: Bitcoin Price Drops as Turkey Bans Crypto Payments Amid Currency Crisis,2021-04-16
3864,"Bitcoin (BTC) sellers remain active from the April 14 all-time high just below $65,000. The largest cryptocurrency was trading around $60,300 at press time as it re-tests support around the 200-period moving average on the four-hour chart.  ",2021-04-16
3865,"Billionaire investor Ray Dalio's fear of governments outlawing bitcoin to preserve their monopoly over currencies has come partly true in Turkey.The currency crisis-riddled country announced a ban on cryptocurrencies as a means of payment early Friday, souring the mood in the bitcoin market. The ban is to take effect April 30.""It is considered that their use [crypto assets] in payments may cause non-recoverable losses for the parties to the transactions due to the above-listed factors, and they include elements that may undermine the confidence in methods and instruments used currently in payments,"" the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey said in a press release titled the ""Regulation on the Disuse of Crypto Assets in Payments.""Bitcoin has come under pressure in the past few hours, falling from $63,000 to $60,700 to trade 3% lower on a 24-hour basis. The weakness is almost certainly due to Turkey's decision as it could set a bad precedent for other crisis-riddled countries struggling to protect their currencies. Morocco has already enacted such a ban and India is expected to introduce one shortly.Dalio warned of coming government curbs last month. ""Every country treasures its monopoly on controlling the supply and demand. They don’t want other monies to be operating or competing, because things can get out of control,"" the founder of Bridgewater Associates,  the world’s largest hedge fund, told Yahoo Finance. Cryptocurrency proponents have long argued that bitcoin is a better means of payment than gold or fiat currencies because its supply is cut by half every four years via a programmed code known as mining reward halving. That puts bitcoin's monetary policy in stark contrast to inflationary policies adopted by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.Citizens of countries facing high inflation and fiat currency crises, such as Turkey, have turned to bitcoin in the past few years, raising hopes of widespread adoption across the globe. Turkey's inflation topped 16% last week, and its currency, the lira, has depreciated by 10% this year, having dropped by 24% in 2020. The country sold almost 11.7 tons of gold in February, as reported by Arab News.Readers should note that Turkey's latest ban does not stop Turkish citizens from trading cryptocurrencies. They can still buy bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. However, exchanges could face some complications due to the payments ban.Also read: Dalio on Bitcoin: ‘Good Probability’ It Will ‘Outlawed’ by US Gov""Local exchanges and some global ones are using regulated payment providers like Papara and Ininal to deposit/withdraw Turkish lira,"" Onur Gözüpek, cryptocurrency consultant at crypto exchange BtcTurk Pro, told CoinDesk in an email. ""After April 30, these providers will not be able to send/receive payments between cryptocurrency exchanges.""""Users will still be able to deposit/withdraw Turkish lira through banks in Turkey. Trading will not be affected,"" Gözüpek added.",2021-04-16
3866,"The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey is banning the use of cryptocurrency for payments throughout the country, becoming the latest country to seek to impose limits on it.The price of bitcoin fell and is now at $60,868.91, down 2.69% in the last 24 hours.According to a report by the official newspaper of the Turkish government and a press release by the central bank on Friday local time, Turkey has introduced the “Regulation on the Disuse of Crypto Assets in Payments.” The trading of cryptocurrencies appears to be unaffected by the regulation.The ban, which is set to go into effect on April 30, follows a similar move by Morocco and a possible coming prohibition in India. It's bound to confirm concerns on the part of some about the wisdom of investing in crypto due to the the possibility of such government prohibitions. Banning cryptocurrency payments throughout the country comes as the Turkish lira has faced significant outside selling pressure.

3867,"The core developers of SushiSwap, an automated market-making decentralized cryptocurrency exchange on the Ethereum blockchain, donated 25 ETH (worth approximately $50,000 at the time) to No Kid Hungry, the charity announced on Wednesday. The Giving Block, a platform that enables nonprofit organizations to accept cryptocurrency donations, handled the transfer. Donors have more than 200 recipient organizations to choose from through the platform, which also offers information and a guide on the tax benefits of crypto donations.“SushiSwap’s donation was incredibly generous, and we’re excited to see teams building in crypto donate to awesome causes like No Kid Hungry,” Alex Wilson, co-founder of The Giving Block, told CoinDesk. “Every major donation like this encourages more nonprofits to accept cryptocurrency donations, pushing adoption further in the nonprofit industry. No Kid Hungry was one of our earliest clients, and they've helped us grow from working with 10 nonprofits to now working with over 200,” Wilson added.The SushiSwap exchange has proven one of the biggest success stories in the recent explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The price of its governance token, SUSHI, skyrocketed to all-time highs above $20 in March, representing a 30-fold gain from its November 2020 low. (Its price was about $18 on Thursday.)In December, No Kid Hungry was one of more than 120 organizations, including Save the Children and The Tor Project, that took part in #BitcoinTuesday, the crypto edition of the annual charity event #GivingTuesday, spearheaded by The Giving Block. According to a March report on No Kid Hungry’s coronavirus response from Executive Chair Billy Shore and President and CEO Tom Nelson, since the beginning of the pandemic last year the organization has provided more than $66 million in grants to 1,800 schools, nonprofits and food banks in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Guam and has served nearly 1 billion meals nationwide. ""It’s been a year now since the pandemic began and the crypto community’s support of No Kid Hungry has helped millions of kids struggling to get the food they need to learn and thrive. It’s been so inspiring to see the truly heartfelt support from crypto donors, all of whom made their gifts to No Kid Hungry through The Giving Block,"" said Diane Clifford, managing director, Constituent Development and Operations of No Kid Hungry.She noted that the SushiSwap core developers' donation ""will provide up to 500,000 meals for kids across America.""No Kid Hungry is among the growing number of nonprofits that have begun to accept crypto donations, including highlighting crypto’s favorable tax treatment under Internal Revenue Service regulations. The IRS treats cryptocurrency donations to 501(c)s or other tax-exempt nonprofits as tax deductible, like stocks and other property, and not subject to capital gains tax.And with increased attention on the crypto space around Coinbase’s direct listing on Wednesday, Wilson sees continued growth in crypto donations to nonprofits. “As the price of crypto continues to increase, so do the potential capital gains tax liabilities. We’re seeing donors use our platform and the causes we work with as a way to do good while also offsetting their capital gains taxes when they take profit on a position,” Wilson said. “Overall, we’re seeing millions of dollars being donated to the causes we work with and don’t expect it to slow down any time soon.”No Kid Hungry currently accepts donations in bitcoin, ether, basic attention token, bitcoin cash, chainlink, dai, litecoin, zcash (ZEC) and others, according to The Giving Block. ",2021-04-15
3868,"There was no better time to launch a new crypto-based predictions market than in 2020. The uncertainty of the U.S. presidential election and the continually shifting narratives around the coronavirus pandemic called out for new ways for society to come to consensus. That’s the founding story Shayne Coplan, the 22-year-old creator of Polymarket, has gotten into the habit of telling. His platform is just the latest in a long line of cryptocurrency-based predictions markets. But it's also a rare example of a crypto-project finding early ""product-market fit.""“We're growing and we've got traction,” he said. Less than a year after founding, and after at least one major code overhaul, Polymarket has grown to do more than $100 million in total volume to date. “That was organic. No s**tcoin, no subsidies, no bots. People just wanted to use this product.”Crypto is full of projects based on sound ideas, stable code and deep pockets that struggle to get off the ground – often because they attempt to reinvent what already works. The projects that seem to take hold, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are usually the ones that execute a simple idea, simply. Polymarket allows users to open a betting market on any subject and launch it as a tamper-proof smart contract on an Ethereum layer 2. Backed by Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan, Meltem Demirors as well as a number of other crypto-focused VCs and builders, it has an air of legitimacy for a project attempting to do what many others have struggled to achieve. See also: Prediction Markets’ Time Has Come, but They Aren’t Ready for ItSome of the earliest, like Augur, and largest, like Gnosis, initial coin offerings were to build crypto-based prediction markets. Augur famously launched after three years of development with a clunky product that only recently upgraded to something more useable. Gnosis has shifted gears to a community-run project after failing to live up to expectations. Other betting markets, like Veil, simply shut down. ""Frankly, no one had pulled it off,"" Coplan said. ""These legacy incumbents who had raised tons of money have never shipped anything usable."" That may be an overstatement, but not by much. Polymarket's strong growth and expanding community has been attributed to its sleek, low-friction design – but it also may be from being in the right place at the right time.Today, there are questions on whether President Biden will still be in office by month’s end, whether Floyd Mayweather will KO Logan Paul, as well as bets on future coronavirus caseloads. There's a lot to be uncertain about, a boon for a product that pitches itself as an antidote to misinformation. New markets are started all the time, with many of them seeing hundreds of bets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some people seem to be looking for consensus opinion about controversial topics, others are gambling on news events – like you might see in any pub.“Both people who are looking for an edge and people who are looking to make better decisions are our North Star for now,” Coplan said. A firm believer in markets theory, Coplan thinks prediction platforms are a genuine way to come to a better understanding of reality. The idea is rooted in economic theory, which Coplan knows inside and out. In a winding interview with CoinDesk, the curly-haired New York University dropout made continual references to legendary Austrian school economist Friedrich Hayek. The thinking goes, when there are economic incentives at play, people are more likely to give an accurate read of uncertain possibilities. They read more and better sources, think deeper and attempt to place their money on whatever realistic outcome is more likely to occur.  “As the coronavirus happened, and there was just so much uncertainty and so many differing opinions, [I thought] ‘If only there were free markets on these topics, so people could put their money where their mouth is,’” Coplan said. This attitude is foundational to the crypto ethos, which distrusts established sources of authority and places a high-degree of responsibility on individual actors.Robin Hanson, associate professor of economics at George Mason University, has tracked the phenomenon for the better part of his career, establishing himself as one of the foremost economists researching prediction markets. “People have noticed that speculative markets have had this information-aggregation benefit,” he told CoinDesk. “That's an observation that goes back centuries.”See also: How Crypto Transforms Prediction MarketsHanson’s primary concern aligns with Coplan’s: determining ways that price action could reveal obscured truths. “The world has just broken in terms of how people come together to share information and draw conclusions.”Where Coplan and Hanson separate is in their willingness to adopt blockchain for this purpose. Coplan thinks prediction markets have been “the Holy Grail” for the cryptocurrency industry since inception. Both crypto and prediction markets can trace their lineage to neoclassical economics, which championed free markets and individual rights.By disintermediating betting markets from centralized players – which could inherently bias a prediction either by determining what questions people are allowed to ask, or otherwise interfering with the outcome – Coplan thinks Polymarket, and its “copycats,” are finally realizing this ideal.“That's like the one true use case for blockchains that really makes sense. It's creating this Mecca of real time, unbiased, perpetually accurate information that anyone in the world can go and reference to make better decisions,” Coplan said. Gwern, an independent AI researcher and long-time prediction markets (PM) user (though not Polymarket), agreed. “Decentralized PMs seem critical in the long run for any kind of widespread adoption,” he said over a direct message. “They're too vulnerable to trusted third party security vulnerabilities: step on too many toes, and speak too much truth to power.”Earlier experiments with crypto-based betting markets, like Augur and Gnosis, were torpedoed by Ethereum’s long-standing scaling problems, he said. Further, both initially launched with a native token, adding friction to the user experience. Polymarket learned from its predecessors' mistakes.Last autumn, Coplan led a team of 10 coders to transpose his platform onto Matic, an Ethereum layer 2, to lower the gas fees involved in placing bets. He also designed the system for users without an ether wallet. All bets are placed in the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, which can be purchased on Polymarket with debit or credit cards, through an integration with Transak. “We grew too quickly and we've encountered a number of problems based on the underlying infrastructure,” Coplan explained. See also: Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin Calls on Power Users to Move to Layer 2 ScalingThe ease of use, as well as the high-profile of many of the platform’s backers has drawn a dedicated user base to Polymarket. A group of mostly anonymous users who call themselves Polymarket Whales track trades on the platform to aggregate on an independent website and broadcast over Twitter. Coplan calls them “professional truth seekers,” though it’s likely they’re amateur researchers, potentially with a stake in many of the open markets. (Polymarket Whales did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)Looking closely at the preserved data on the blockchain sometimes reveals the odd ways prediction markets make sense of the world. There was a bet on whether Kanye West and Kim Kardashian would file for divorse before Jan. 1, 2021 – a prediction that ultimately missed the mark by about a month, but points to the predictive ability of crowds. Coplan thought that divorce market was “irrelevant” – just Page Six gossip – but pointed to examples of where Polymarket helped uncover useful information. During the Suez Canal crisis, which saw a lodged tanker block access to one of trade finance’s arteries, whales were pulling information about wind speeds, Egyptian river flows and other “seemingly arbitrary details” that helped people build a better understanding of the situation. Like any market-based system, elements of greed and unethical games can often seep in. LessWrong, a rationalist blog, detailed what looked like a Tesla insider placing a bet on whether the auto manufacturer would buy bitcoin just days before the pivotal event occurred. It was apparently his or her first trade, and a large gamble at that. They pocketed $120,000, data shows.This type of activity has Hanson, the economist, wondering about the actual societal benefit of platforms like Polymarket. To him, browsing the site, it seemed like it was missing the point of what a well-formed predictions market could provide. Namely, predictions are supposed to help inform actual behavior – otherwise you’re running numbers for the mob.“Those are the kinds of information that are valuable,” he said. “But merely generating information on a topic where nobody is taking substantial actions is not actually very valuable. There's no point.” See also: Martin Glazier – Enterprise Blockchain Doesn’t Work Because It’s About the Real WorldHanson said Polymarket should add conditional variations on the questions people can raise. Rather than framing whether an event may happen with a binary yes or no, there would be more value for users if they could ask about likely outcomes based on changing circumstances. (Coplan says conditional markets could be in the offing.)Coplan acknowledges that markets are only fit to answer some types of questions. “Truth is oftentimes probabilistic rather than definite,” he said. “The ability to draft a market on something is a good litmus test for how legitimate it is.”There could be other reasons for participating in a predictions market, Hanson added. It could just be plain fun. It could also be a decent way to make a buck. Gwern, who only ever bet low amounts, said it was mostly for intellectual stimulation. The frivolity of today’s decentralized predictions markets may be their saving grace, Hanson said. Historically, decentralized prediction markets sold themselves as a way to bypass existing laws, he said. Nonprofit, centralized markets PredictIt and the Iowa Electronic Market, for instance, operate in the U.S. under the legal protection of a no-action letter from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). “They do have a lot of regulations available to them to enforce,” he said, but have mostly turned a blind eye because it’s a nascent industry that hasn’t done much harm yet. But because Polymarket doesn't book revenue – Coplan gave a non-committal response when asked if he was thinking about monetizing it – and because it never launched a token, it might become an accepted part of the internet’s open architecture. It sounds like the type of probabilistic questions Polymarket was set up to ask.",2021-04-15
3869,"The Reddit forum famous for making GameStop’s (GME) stock price a household topic has banned all discussion of cryptocurrencies less than 24 hours after tentatively allowing a daily discussion thread, with restrictions.WallStreetBets, a subreddit that describes itself as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal,” has long banned cryptocurrency discussion. It lifted this ban on three cryptocurrencies – bitcoin, ether and dogecoin – though it continued banning “crypto spam” on Wednesday, after Coinbase’s direct public listing. On Thursday, the ban was reinstated, citing the deleterious effects of a Bloomberg article.“Due to the article that was written @bloomberg who somehow felt that ‘WallStreetBets Bows to Crypto,’” wrote moderator u/bawse1. “Crypto discussion is banned indefinitely.

3871,"Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital asset manager, has taken an equity stake in exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer ClearShares – just as the issuer converted one of its ETF ticker symbols, from PIFI to BTC. The move comes a little over a week after Grayscale confirmed that it was committed to converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), to an ETF. Among competition from other closed-end funds and bitcoin ETFs in Canada, GBTC has been trading at a discount for more than a month. Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.""Grayscale has taken an ownership stake in ClearShares as part of its long-term commitment to bring digital currency ETFs to market, with the potential to collaborate on products with investment strategies related to the digital currency industry,” a Grayscale spokeswoman said. Bitcoin ETFs have seen renewed interest in 2020 and 2021 as vehicles that would allow retail and institutional investors exposure to the asset class when they don’t want to touch bitcoin itself. In the past, the SEC has rejected every bitcoin ETF application, but incoming SEC Chair Gary Gensler could change the regulator’s attitude to the novel investment product. Gensler is a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman who has taught crypto and blockchain courses at MIT in recent years. ClearShares is a small ETF issuer that hasn’t done anything in the cryptocurrency or digital asset space, said James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The fund formerly known as PIFI only had $32 million assets under management and “hasn’t done all that well performance-wise,” he added.Converting ETFs to a different strategy is common among issuers, Seyffart said. One such example was when ETF Managers Group converted a Latin American Real Estate (LARE) ETF to a marijuana ETF with the ticker symbol MJX (later MJ). It’s unclear whether Grayscale bought a minority or majority stake in ClearShares. CoinDesk reached out to ClearShares to clarify the terms of the deal, but an external spokesman who works with Grayscale responded instead, saying Grayscale would not comment on the terms. While Grayscale has been hiring ETF specialists, it's possible the investment manager could be planning to use ClearShares to launch its ETF business or its stake may be part of buying the rights to the BTC symbol, Seyffart said.“Exchanges own the tickers and issuers can put a ticker on hold for a number of years or certain time period if an issuer has the rights to a ticker at a specific exchange that could be valuable,” he said.Coinbase, for example, went to Nasdaq for its public listing because the exchange could offer it the COIN ticker.",2021-04-15

News of this tie-up, which CoinDesk broke earlier Thursday, sent the price of DOGE to a new record.The social media-savvy snack food saw its Twitter follower count increase 160% and tweet impressions soar to the moon (35 million impressions in 25 days) after it began engaging in Shiba Inu meme coin content last quarter, according to the CEO of parent company Conagra Brands.“We've seen a marked uptick in audience interaction, including direct engagement and advocacy from the person [who] created dogecoin,” CEO Sean Connolly said on Conagra’s April 8 earnings call. Exemplifying the hype-prone state of the cryptocurrency market right now, the publication of this story earlier today was enough to cause DOGE to more than double to a new high-water mark of 29.8 cents from 13.6 cents before the report. In recent trading, DOGE had settled down to 28.8 cents, up 127% on the day and more than 4,800% year to date. On the earnings call, Connolly credited the dogecoin community with “playing a large part” in delivering Slim Jim the ultimate win in Adweek’s March Madness-themed brand face-off earlier this month. The callout, apparently the first time dogecoin has ever been featured in an earnings call, and certainly the first instance of a public company deploying a bona fide strategy around DOGE (no, Elon’s memes don’t count), highlights how dogecoin has become a serious business while staying true to its roots as an objectively ridiculous meme coin.The infinitely inflationary early bitcoin spin-off rocketed to new all-time highs amid a broad crypto-market rally that preceded Coinbase’s Nasdaq listing on Wednesday, and propelled further by this story. That DOGE is trading at record levels is a fact Slim Jim’s social team does not want its audience to forget.Connolly said Slim Jim’s community “is built on memes,” which, as it happens, is dogecoin’s base, too.

3874,"Ether's options market is witnessing an explosive growth as the second-biggest cryptocurrency rallies to fresh all-time highs above $2,400. Open interest, or the total number of open long and short positions in call and put options, rose to a record $3.3 billion Wednesday, topping the previous peak of nearly $3 billion observed on March 13, according to data provider Skew.The value of open positions has gone up by roughly $1 billion since March 26, and ether's price has appreciated by over 50% over that period. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, jumped early Thursday to a new all-time high of $2,487. Options trading volume has increased rapidly to $425 million, from $183 million as recently as late March. Open interest in the ether futures market has also jumped to new record highs above $8 billion. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents the right to buy, and the put option gives the right to sell.While open interest has surged with the cryptocurrency's price, ether's one-month implied volatility (IV), or investors' expectation for price turbulence, remains low.Volatility peaked above 190% (annualized) in January and fell to a four-month low of 73% on March 28. Since then, it is hovering in a narrow range below its lifetime average of 88%, confounding observers. As noted by dominant exchange Deribit, expectations for price turbulence in crypto markets rise during both bull and bear runs. That's contrary to traditional markets, where implied volatility usually picks up during bear markets and subsides during bull runs.According to Greg Magadini, CEO and co-founder of Genesis Volatility, ether's implied volatility is being dragged lower by bitcoin (BTC).""Although ETH holds an IV premium over BTC, I believe bitcoin options lead the crypto options market, and IV fatigue in BTC is possibly bleeding into ETH,"" Magadini told CoinDesk.Bitcoin's one-month implied volatility is also hovering below its lifetime average of 74.7% at press time. However, ether's implied volatility will likely decouple from bitcoin's once institutional money flows into Ethereum's native cryptocurrency.""Bitcoin's market has gotten used to institutional inflows. However, ether has not had huge corporate buyers, and any news of that would be a ""surprise"" to the market,"" Magadini said. ""That makes ETH options interesting here.""Also read: Bitcoin in Stasis as Crypto Bull Mike Novogratz Warns of Market Washout Traders usually buy options when the market is seeing below-average implied volatility and sell options when the IV is too high.

3875,"The code for Taproot’s “Speedy Trial,” an activation method for Bitcoin’s biggest upgrade in years, has been merged into Bitcoin Core.On April 15, Bitcoin Core developers Fanquake and Marco Falke merged two complementary pull requests authored by AJ Townes and Andrew Chow for Speedy Trial. With Speedy Trial now merged into Bitcoin Core’s source code, Taproot’s code is ready to start its first step toward activation when the code is released in May.Bitcoin’s community, from developers to avid users, all agree that Taproot, which implements the Schnorr signature scheme into Bitcoin code, will be a boon for the network by making complex transactions (what the cool kids call “smart contracts”) more scalable and private. No one has agreed on how to bring Taproot online, though. Because Bitcoin is decentralized, it requires painstaking coordination between actors to make sure an upgrade is released properly. After months and months of activation discussions led to a stalemate, Bitcoin developer David Harding and Russell O'Connor devised Speedy Trial as a way to put an end to the impasse. The compromise allots a three-month activation window, during which time the network requires a certain threshold of miners to signal for the upgrade; if this threshold is reached, then Taproot is “locked in” and activates in November of this year.Should this trial fail, then Taproot doesn’t activate (and the network will have only wasted three months trying, hence “speedy”). Speedy Trial brokered an agreement between those who wanted an activation via Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 9, which means the upgrade fails if miners don’t adopt, and BIP8, which gives node operators (those running Bitcoin’s source code who act as “servers” for the network) an option to force the upgrade with a user activated soft fork if it fails.Miners have shown no signs of blocking the upgrade, making the drawn-out discussions a source of frustration for some stakeholders.Correction: April 16, 2021, 00:05 UTC: This article was corrected to note that the pull requests were merged by Fanquake and Marco Falke, not Greg Maxwell.Correction: April 19, 2021, 20:47 UTC: This article was corrected to clarify when Taproot would activate if Speedy Trial is effective.",2021-04-15
3876,"Ethereum and multi-chain oracle service Chainlink is building out a new oracle network that could provide a solution (in part) to both scalability and front-running issues.Dubbed Chainlink 2.0, the network creates what its team calls “decentralized oracle networks” (DONs). These second-layer networks operate off-chain, meaning almost all of the data related to the smart contract is stored and computed off-chain before an oracle makes an input on the blockchain to trigger a smart contract’s outcome.For example, if you had a smart contract that managed trades between ETH and UNI, Chainlink 2.0’s oracles would aggregate all the various exchange data for this pair and only feed the on-chain smart contract the exact price when needed. Taking this further, for more complex smart contracts that require more data (like ones for options or collateralized tokens), something like off-chain oracle services could potentially mitigate miners front-running trades on-chain.Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov likened these DONs to the application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers use for everyday computer functions (whenever you Google something and Google’s own result comes up, for weather or bitcoin price, for example, this data is pulled using an API.)""Our work with the top DeFi protocols has clearly shown us that in order to create the next generation of smart contracts developers need an easily accessible, provably secure and scalable set of decentralized services surrounding their smart contract code with key additional functionality,"" Nazarov told CoinDesk.In the Bitcoin ecosystem, so-called discreet log contracts (DLCs) require similar off-chain oracle services.",2021-04-15

You could even attribute some of the price appreciation this week squarely to this much-anticipated event,"" crypto exchange EQUOS said in its daily market analysis email.However, XRP, dogecoin and few other cryptocurrencies also rallied despite not being listed on Coinbase. XRP picked up a bid near $0.6 on April 5 and clocked a three-year high of $1.9 on Wednesday – a 220% gain in nine days. Dogecoin has surged by 85% in the past three days.As per Novogratz, that shows Coinbase's listing on Nasdaq created a lot of euphoria – a point of maximum financial risk where investors, primarily retailers, think good times will continue unchecked. It's usually the time when the market sees a temporary correction.According to Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, the market is now seeing a classic sell-the-fact reaction to the news. Bitcoin, XRP and others have pulled back from the highs seen on Wednesday.""It’s quite common for a market to run up in anticipation of an event before then selling off on the news itself,"" Kruger told CoinDesk, adding that the cryptocurrency may track COIN in the short-term.Coinbase's shares witnessed a two-way business or indecisive price action on the first day of trading, as noted earlier. If the share price drops in the coming days, the cryptocurrency may test $58,820, according to Equos.Dips, however, are likely to be shallow. ""I would expect buying interest, detached in mindset from the noise of the day, to arrive and happily soak as weak hands leave the market.” Equos' analyst noted.According to Kruger, the focus would soon shift back to the bigger picture and macro drivers. Data released earlier this week showed the U.S. headline inflation rose to a 12-month pace of 2.6% in March, strengthening the case for continued investments in store of value assets such as bitcoin and gold.""All those narratives are still true, and there's a lot of money on the sidelines, especially in the institutional world that has not been deployed yet,"" Alex Svanevik, the CEO of blockchain data company Nansen told CoinDesk. ""I don't see a reason for a big correction.""Novogratz also remains bullish on bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole and foresees bitcoin at $500,000 by 2024.",2021-04-15

3882,"Toronto-based ePIC blockchain has wrapped up a $7.5 million series A funding round to bring ASIC manufacturing to North America.“North America excels in a lot of chip technology, so there’s no reason that North America shouldn’t excel in Blockchain ASIC design and manufacturing,” ePIC CEO Henry Quan told CoinDesk. “There’s a lack of supply. New entrants can’t come in and get access to technology, so it’s kept a lot of players out.”So-called application specific circuit (ASIC) miners are built specifically for mining cryptocurrencies, typically bitcoin, because they produce the hashes needed to mine blocks at a much more rapid rate than graphics cards or normal computer processors. ePIC currently builds ASICs for altcoins.ASIC manufacturing is a sub-industry that, like crypto’s larger mining industry, is concentrated in China. As the only ASIC manufacturer in North America with a live product, ePIC’s expansion, (and any other’s that follow it) could relieve a supply-chain bottleneck that has plagued North American miners particularly during this bull market, causing a lack of access to mining machines.“Having a North American ASIC manufacturer is critical for the long-term security of the Bitcoin network given supply chain constraints coming out of China and the need for more hashrate based in NA,” Ethan Vera, the CFO of North American mining pool and technology company Luxor, told CoinDesk.“The growth of the Chinese mining ecosystem was a partial result of proximity to ASIC manufacturers. We can expect the same relationship to hold true with a North American ASIC manufacturer.”The mining manufacturer’s customers include Argo, an American miner with a foothold in Texas, and CoreScientific, the largest mining datacenter provider in North America. ePIC will use the funding to produce its 3rd generation ASIC model which will be used to mine a “top 10 cryptocurrency,” according to Quan. The new rig is codenamed Amnesia and is forthcoming in Q4 of this year. ePIC currently produces ASICs to mine decentralized storage project Siacoin. With a team stacked with alumni from microchip manufacturer AMD, Quan told CoinDesk that developing Bitcoin ASICs is on the company’s roadmap. Over the past year, miners have been in a mad dash for the metal, energy and warehouse necessary to expand their operations to cash in on the digital gold rush.But the demand has meant that many miners, particularly those an ocean away from the foundries that source the machines they need, have to wait to access hardware. This has sent the price of old machines skyrocketing, as even machines as old as 2014 were in profit, leading into Bitcoin’s largest difficult adjustment this month.Investment into North America’s mining sector has shown no signs of slowing, with some major players attempting to increase their hashrate as much as tenfold by the end of the year. Manufacturers like ePIC could correct the lopsided supply chain logistics these miners currently face.“North America could be a mining powerhouse but three key pieces need to come together for that to happen. There’s a lot of cheap energy here, commercial miners and a favorable political climate, so that’s the first thing. Mining pools are another piece, which we have with Luxor and DCG. And now, we have the third piece with ePIC and ASIC manufacturing,” he said.Quan would not specify when the company will begin producing ASICs for bitcoin mining. He commented that “bitcoin ASICs are the holy grail,” but to “compete in that market, one needs a lot of capital and access to leading edge foundry nodes such as 5 nanometer,” perhaps something for series B round, he intimated.Luxor’s Vera commented that “starting with altcoin miners is an interesting way to approach creating a new bitcoin ASIC company as often it is less competitive and can be a good testing ground before entering the major leagues.”",2021-04-14
3883,"Over $623 million worth of bitcoin (BTC) stolen from Bitfinex in 2016 was moved on Wednesday, according to Twitter account Whale Alert, coming on the same day the whole market celebrated a milestone in crypto history: Coinbase's direct listing on Nasdaq.",2021-04-14
3884,"Fundamentals seem to be taking the back seat to the hype of the moment; Coinbase’s direct listing today on Nasdaq looks like the one thing that is driving up the whole crypto market. Nonetheless, there are indeed fundamental factors at play as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies trade near all-time highs. Bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose to near $65,000 during early trading hours in the U.S. on Wednesday, hours before Coinbase shares began trading on the Nasdaq.Spot trading volume on eight crypto exchanges tracked by CoinDesk, although slightly lower than a day ago, continued to show increased activity and was near $4 billion at press time.While it may seem like Coinbase’s Nasdaq listing has been pumping prices in bitcoin and other cryptos, Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, views it the other way around. According to him, Coinbase timed the listing with bitcoin bull’s run. “Coinbase isn’t pumping bitcoin. Bitcoin is pumping Coinbase,” he said in his newsletter Wednesday.At press time, 98 cryptocurrencies on Messari are worth more than $1 billion – the number was 100 during early trading hours in the U.S. on Wednesday.Coinbase’s direct listing “is timely,” wrote Philip Gradwell, chief economist at blockchain data firm Chainalysis, in his newsletter on April 14. “The market has radically changed in the last six months with the entry of new, often very large, institutional investors, who have paid high prices for their cryptocurrency.”Indeed, despite the hype, bitcoin’s market fundamentals may give a more meaningful explanation on why bitcoin’s price has continued to triumph.More than 2 million BTC have changed hands on the blockchain at prices above $50,000, according to Gradwell, while about 608,000 BTC were acquired at prices at or above $57,000.“It demonstrates the level of investment in cryptocurrency: those 2.3 million at or above $50,000 for bitcoin cost $125 billion,” Gradwell wrote. “Such levels of investment require large companies that can face the scrutiny of the public market.”At the same time, the so-called coin years destroyed (CYD) metric tracked by Glassnode also indicates that bitcoin long-term holders (“HODLers”) are still in the accumulation phase, providing further bullish support to the price.Read More: Bitcoin Uptrend Intact as HODLers Seem Less Tempted to SellEther, along with many other alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), also logged more gains on Wednesday.Besides ether, which is the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, one of the most staggering growth spurts was seen with dogecoin (DOGE), the beloved meme cryptocurrency that was created back in 2013.As a result, dogecoin now has a market capitalization of more than $16 billion, surpassing that of bitcoin cash (BCH) and chainlink (LINK), per Messari data.Dogecoin’s sudden price surge also came with escalating trading activity: data from CoinGecko also shows that dogecoin is the No. 5 most traded token of the day, only behind tether (USDT), bitcoin, ether  and XRP.Other digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly lower on Wednesday.

3885,"When people ask, ""How big is the crypto market?"", the answer mostly depends on how much bitcoin is worth. That's because in crypto bitcoin is in some ways the only true ""large cap"" asset. To get an idea of how much bitcoin is worth compared to others, consider the S&P 500 index, composed of large-cap stocks and used by traders as a benchmark for the market. Apple, worth $2.2 trillion, is worth about 6.5% of the entire index. Now, imagine if it were instead worth $20 trillion and were two-thirds the S&P 500. That's the situation bitcoin is in relative to all other cryptocurrencies.However, it is important to categorize crypto assets by size. The Digital Large Cap Index (DLCX) covers what might be considered the large-cap segment of the crypto asset universe: the top 70% by cumulative market cap. (This is the threshold MSCI, an index provider, uses to define the large-cap category.) ""Bitcoin dominance"" is a metric that measures bitcoin's share of the aggregate market cap of all cryptocurrencies. It's also often used to measure investor interest in altcoins. The chart above shows the minimum bitcoin dominance rate in each quarter. As bitcoin reached all-time highs, crypto's total market cap rose above $2 trillion just at the end of the first quarter. However, bitcoin dominance slid to lows not seen in two years because the value of every other cryptocurrency combined rose faster than the first crypto. This underscores the need for an index capable of covering market dynamics like this.Last quarter saw changes in the composition of the index for the first time since its inception in 2018. On Jan. 5, we excluded XRP, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the currency's issuer, Ripple, alleging the asset is an unregistered security. Regulatory risk is one of the subjective index composition criteria. Last month, I wrote about how a newer generation of altcoins has been outpacing some of the stalwart large-cap alts in returns. Chainlink (LINK) was one of the top assets for the quarter by returns. The chart above shows how its average quarterly market cap reflected the gains, more than doubling, to cross the $10 billion mark. That put the chainlink token into large-cap territory, but market cap is not the only criterion for inclusion. The index is designed to be replicable by U.S. financial institutions: firms that use it to trade or create financial products must be able to access liquid markets for the constituent assets. The chart above shows chainlink's sum quarterly volume in U.S. dollar trading pairs on exchanges that are accessible to U.S. financial institutions. This picture of chainlink's liquidity is distinct from one that might include volumes reported by offshore exchanges and volumes in pairs against stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies. As the chart shows, chainlink's volume on institutionally viable exchanges also doubled its previous quarterly high in Q1. When bitcoin trades in a band, as it has for the past month, some investors begin to anticipate a dramatic break, in one direction or another. As chainlink’s data shows, Q1 brought dramatic changes in the altcoin landscape. That change is reflected in the DLCX. It's just a hunch, but I feel it's possible further shifts may be in store in Q2. ",2021-04-14
3886,"Coinbase, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, went live with its direct listing on Nasdaq, on a day when bitcoin rallied to a fresh all-time high.The shares fluctuated in the first hours of trading, starting at $381 and initially jumping above $400 but dropping as of press time to about $378.“The price of COIN will be very volatile,” said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University who specializes in financial-market structure. “We can expect it to fluctuate along with the prices of cryptocurrencies. Investors should buckle up their seatbelts and expect a wild ride.”Analysts, traders and economists characterized the share sale as a milestone for cryptocurrencies, with the biggest U.S. exchange now getting exposure to mainstream stock-market investors. The event has also been tabbed as a catalyst that might drive adoption of digital assets.“This is a watershed moment for the digital asset industry, as it signifies a larger moment of credibility for a market that is maturing rapidly,” said Hunter Merghart, head of U.S. for rival cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp.Based on the latest trading price, Coinbase would have a market capitalization of $76 billion, based on an outstanding share count of 199.2 million. The figure would be $99 billion using the fully diluted share count of 261.3 million.The initial trading price was 52% above the reference price of $250 a share published late Tuesday by the Nasdaq. But it was well below some of the price targets issued recently by stock analysts, with some estimates ranging as high as $600 a share.Coinbase, which has no official headquarters, opted to avoid an initial public offering (IPO) and instead directly list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange, without relying on Wall Street investment banks serving as underwriters to set the pricing.“The reason we’re doing a direct listing is that it’s going to get all market participants,” Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas told CoinDesk in an interview. “We’re not allocating shares to just 10 institutions. This is going to be a robust, deep price discovery. And we’re excited to see where that market ends up.”Prices for bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, soared Wednesday to a new all-time high above $64,000, settling back to about $63,500 as of press time. Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall, also rose to a record price of around $2,400.“COIN listing is the validation of an investment thesis that crypto is not a niche market anymore,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University. “It is a new mainstream market.”Even Coinbase’s competitors are getting in on the action: Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced Wednesday it will list a digital token backed by Coinbase shares.“Coinbase has enormous scarcity value, as a one-of-a-kind, pure expression of the secular cryptocurrency trend,” Lisa Ellis, an analyst for the brokerage firm MoffettNathanson, wrote Tuesday in a report recommending a ""buy"" on COIN shares, with a one-year price target of $600 a share. “We are bullish on cryptocurrency technology. While still nascent, we believe it is one of the most disruptive technology innovations in decades.”Coinbase has consistently created new venture capital funding records in crypto, so it was befitting that the exchange would move forward with the first direct listing in the space.The company’s growth prospects have become the subject of a great deal of analyst speculation after a blowout first-quarter earnings presentation last week that showed off the profitability of the company but also the volatility of its business model.The exchange reported $1.8 billion in revenue for the quarter (versus $1.27 billion for the full year 2020). Coinbase gave no revenue guidance (as a publicly traded company normally would), but instead gave scenarios for user growth depending on different outcomes in the crypto market. It reported 6.1 million active users in the first quarter, more than double the number during the final quarter of 2020.Some industry analysts were skeptical of Coinbase’s sky-high valuation.“It does seem difficult to justify these numbers,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics. “There is the old saying that in a gold rush, the ones who make the most money are the guys selling picks and shovels. This certainly applies to Coinbase.”Coinbase requires investors to not only have a view on the future of bitcoin but also on other crypto exchanges and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that will be competing with it for market share, Duke’s Harvey said. (The Duke University endowment was an early investor in Coinbase.)“To simply extrapolate from past results ignores the competition,” Harvey said. “Most people are operating in the world of centralized finance and [decentralized finance] is not just a novel cryptocurrency. It’s reinventing financial infrastructure.”While many equity analysts are looking at how Coinbase is turning its large pool of users into active users that trade on the app every month, some have said that COIN could end up trading like a proxy bitcoin ETF, as some investors are now possibly using MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares.It also means that pension funds and endowments will be looking at other early-stage private companies in the crypto space that have the potential to follow Coinbase’s growth history, Harvey added.“Developments like this help bring confidence to this still nascent, but as the last year has demonstrated, resilient, asset class,” David Mercer, CEO of the LMAX crypto exchange, said in an emailed comment.",2021-04-14
3887,"The near two-fold rise in bitcoin (BTC) over the past year has rewarded long-term holders (hodlers) who are still in the accumulation phase. This suggests that, following bitcoin’s break to an all-time high above $63,000, bullish activity is just getting started.BTC is roughly 3% lower at the time of writing after reaching an all-time high around $64,800. But despite short-term profit taking, the long-term uptrend is intact.""It is likely that the coins purchased by institutions in late 2020 and early 2021 are starting to mature,” according to a recent report by Glassnode, a cryptocurrency analytics firm. “The HODLer Position Change metric is trending higher and if these institutional buyers did HODL, it is likely to continue in this trajectory over the coming months.”Macroeconomic factors could be a driving force for long-term bitcoin holdings. Many investors see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and continued dollar debasement. And the search for yield could encourage greater flows into bitcoin.“We could see flows out of fixed income and into cryptocurrencies as rates rise,” said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, a market analysis and advisory firm, during an interview with CoinDesk. This could usher in a new generation of HODLers seeking high-yield potential.",2021-04-14
3888,"It’s official: Gary Gensler is the new chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a 53-45 vote by the U.S. Senate on Wednesday.Gensler, who was nominated to the position by President Joe Biden in January, previously ran the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), overseeing the implementation of new regulations around derivatives in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. As SEC chair, he’ll have ample opportunity to shape regulations addressing the cryptocurrency industry – or determine how existing regulations should apply. “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have brought new thinking to payments and financial inclusion, but they’ve also raised new issues of investor protection that we still need to attend to,” Gensler said during a confirmation hearing held by the Senate Banking Committee last month. “If confirmed at the SEC, I’d work with fellow commissioners to both promote the new innovation, but also at the core to ensure investor protection.”Gensler will take office as his agency grapples with a number of high-profile actions in the cryptocurrency space, including its ongoing lawsuit against Ripple, which the SEC has accused of violating federal securities laws, and nine bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, which industry participants have clamored for for years. He has already weighed in on some of these issues as a private citizen lecturing at MIT. In 2018, he called XRP a “non-compliant security,” and said other initial coin offerings might violate U.S. securities laws.The SEC will also be watching as Coinbase goes public on Wednesday, following the agency’s deeming its form S-1 effective (essentially a tacit approval). Gensler will also have to deal with a number of issues around the existing stock market, including the Gamestop volatility from earlier this year.Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chair of the committee, endorsed Gensler’s nomination ahead of Wednesday’s vote, calling him an “experienced public servant with a strong record of holding Wall Street accountable.”Gensler ""will lead the SEC at a time when it’s become more and more obvious to most people that the stock market is detached from the reality of working families’ lives,” he said during floor debate on Tuesday.",2021-04-14
3889,"Coinbase going public today is the last stock listing that will ever matter.That may not be true, but isn’t it kind of odd that that sentence doesn’t sound entirely off base?Coinbase, the Silicon Valley-based cryptocurrency exchange, today plans to directly list 114,850,769 existing shares on Nasdaq. Its valuations range from $65 billion and $100 billion and beyond. That would make it more valuable than traditional exchanges like New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange and the exchange Coinbase’s stock (COIN) will trade on.The listing is a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Once shunned by financial giants, crypto is now marching inexorably to mass adoption bringing institutions along with it.Coinbase’s pitch to potential investors is largely that of crypto itself: That decentralized, open financial technologies will disrupt the way we do business. Founded in 2012, Coinbase’s mission has been to make crypto trading as easy as sending email.By most accounts, it has succeeded. The second-largest exchange by trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap, Coinbase boasts 56 million users globally and $223 billion assets on its platform. It’s garnered over $3.4 billion in total revenue since its inception. What started out as merely an onramp has grown into what some call a crypto-native bank.The road here has been bumpy. Coinbase reports that 95% of its revenue comes from trading fees. In times of market exuberance, the exchange is remarkably profitable. With BTC and ETH rising to all-time highs, Coinbase reported revenues of $1.8 billion in Q1, more than double what it saw throughout 2020.There have also been lean times; the exchange ran a $45 million deficit in 2019. Other years, it made existential decisions. The unpredictability of the crypto markets is one of the many risks Coinbase cited in its going-public prospectus – along with the reemergence of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.Apart from an industry downturn, skeptics think Coinbase might find itself in a race-towards-the-bottom scenario related to its core business. Right now, Coinbase charges a significant premium for trading on its platform – attributed to its status as a regulated, and historically-secure exchange.As Fortune noted, even though volumes on Nasdaq and ICE far exceed those on Coinbase, the crypto exchange’s margins are about 50 times higher. But as other exchanges enter the fray or look to compete – be they centralized competitors like Binance or decentralized protocols like Uniswap – Coinbase could be forced to reduce fees.Stock research firm New Constructs compared the situation to what happened to brokerage fees when Robinhood entered the picture. “The firm’s competitive position will inevitably deteriorate,” the researchers wrote.Still, Coinbase’s central position to an industry that is reshaping the world means it’s not going anyway. Institutions that are unable or unwilling to buy cryptocurrencies directly may view the exchange’s stock as a way to gain exposure to the sector.Crypto itself is just beginning. Coinbase is just the first major crypto firm to go public in the U.S. There will be many more. Wallets, custodians, payments firms are building a new digital-first financial system that are out-disrupting the disruptors.Fintechs are still media darlings, but their attachment to the legacy system that crypto is eating may be their demise. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported Stripe had a banner pandemic year. It’s now reportedly valued at $95 billion. But will its public offering generate as much buzz as Coinbase's?",2021-04-14

Read this post for a recap of COIN's Nasdaq debut.Coinbase appeared headed for a valuation of $100 billion or more as analysts and onlookers awaited the trading debut of shares in the leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.While historical experience with such direct listings suggested that trading might not go live until later in the day, financial news services were reporting early indications of the pricing. Around 1:04 p.m. ET, Reuters reported that Coinbase was indicated to start trading at $380, well above the reference price of $250 published late Tuesday by Nasdaq. The stock ticker is COIN. “The price of COIN will be very volatile,"" said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University who specializes in financial-market structure.

It's currently signaling a share price of $432. The latest share-price indication, assuming 199.2 million shares outstanding, would imply a market capitalization for Coinbase of about $76 billion – roughly the same amount as BP, the oil company, and General Motors, the automaker. Using the fully diluted share count of 261.3 million, the implied market capitalization would be about $99 billion. (Coinbase is only listing its 130.7 million of Class A shares.)Late Tuesday, the reference point for Coinbase's hotly-anticipated direct listing was set at $250 a share. The reference point is the low end of the expected opening trading range in a direct listing such as Coinbase's.Given how that's almost $100 below the $343.58 the shares had been trading at in the private secondary market, it's almost certain that the opening price for the Coinbase shares will be far above $250 after buyers and sellers eventually assign a value to the shares of the leading cryptocurrency exchange.

DCG, the world's largest digital asset manager, is the parent of CoinDesk.Haas, the Coinbase CFO, said Nasdaq set the reference price and that the company wasn't involved. “I learned about the reference price 10 minutes before the market learned about the reference price,"" said Haas. “The company is sort of, frankly, a little bit ignoring it.

3895,"Why wait for the Coinbase listing of its shares on the Nasdaq? There’s already a way – in cryptocurrency markets – to bet on the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange.It’s a digital token linked to the success of Binance, which boasts a higher spot trading volume than Coinbase, according to the data site CoinGecko. The token, binance coin (BNB), has surged 14-fold in price this year, for a market value of $86 billion. Some cryptocurrency investors see BNB as a way to get excess return over a simple purchase of bitcoin, whose doubling in price this year looks almost paltry by comparison, Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of crypto data firm The TIE, told CoinDesk in an interview.“Funds can’t just buy bitcoin, because if the funds just buy bitcoin it’s not worth it for their investors,” Frank said. Binance coin “is one of those larger coins that they can get exposure to, and they can put a large position in.”Binance press officials said they didn’t know why BNB has rallied so dramatically this year. The token's price “is not something that can be controlled,” according to a spokesperson. But cryptocurrency analysts said Binance’s recent business moves, including launching a blockchain network to compete with Ethereum for a share of the decentralized finance market, known as DeFi, have helped to boost the BNB token’s prospects.Unlike Coinbase’s soon-to-be-issued shares, BNB tokens confer no equity ownership rights. Binance is a closely-held firm, still led by its founder, Changpeng Zhao, often referred to by his initials, CZ.   Instead, BNB is considered an “exchange token.” It can be used to pay fees on various Binance trading platforms, sometimes entitling the payers to discounts, or even as a currency on blockchain networks sponsored by the exchange. Investors in the token are essentially betting on its supply and demand, which effectively translates to a bet on the success of the Binance ecosystem. Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a less decentralized public blockchain that’s considered a competitor with the Ethereum blockchain, has been quite successful. With transaction fees that are about 35 times cheaper, BSC has overtaken Ethereum in the first three months of 2021 for daily unique active wallets, according to DappRadar’s 2021 Q1 overview report on April 1.In March, the total value locked in Venus, the top decentralized money-market protocol on BSC, surpassed that of some of the most popular DeFi projects on Ethereum, including Uniswap and Compound, DappRadar wrote in its report, citing data from Defistation.The huge success of Binance Smart Chain has played a significant role in BNB’s rapid growing value. As a “discount token,” BNB offers discounts for trading on both Binance’s decentralized exchange (Binance DEX) and Binance, according to Nick Mancini, research analyst at Trade The Chain.The TIE’s Frank told CoinDesk that many crypto-native hedge funds have recognized BSC as a “much cheaper and more effective way” to access DeFi than stomaching Ethereum’s transaction fees, known as “gas,” where rates have soared due to network congestion.BNB is used as gas to pay for DeFi deployment to BSC.Mancini speculated that BNB’s market capitalization might eventually overtake that of ether, the Ethereum blockchain network’s native cryptocurrency. Ether prices have tripled this year, to a market value just over $260 billion. “If BNB and ether continue to grow at the same rate, BNB will flip ether within the next two to four months,” Mancini said.It can’t be overstated that BNB’s price surge has come during “alt season” – a stretch of time where crypto traders have bid up so-called altcoins, ostensibly due to a lull in bitcoin’s rally.This is evidenced by recent drop in bitcoin’s share of all cryptocurrencies’ value, known as the market dominance ratio, to a two-year low.Crypto hedge funds trying to beat the market may also have been forced to invest in altcoins like BNB.Fund managers typically impose a “2 and 20” annual fee structure, meaning a 2% management fee of a fund’s net asset value and a 20% performance fee. Since there are so many ways for investors to hold bitcoin at low cost, crypto hedge funds have to come up with “unique ways” of beating the largest cryptocurrency’s returns for less costly fees, Frank said.“Funds can’t just buy bitcoin because if the funds just buy bitcoin, it’s not worth it for their investors,” Frank said. “Funds have to go out and deploy so much capital, and binance coin is one of those larger coins that they can get exposure to and they can put a large position in.”The Coinbase stock listing might be another potential driver of BNB’s gains.While Binance’s CZ has told CoinDesk that the company does not plan to go public, the token ecosystem might be benefiting from speculation over Coinbase’s value.A pre-listing tracking contract traded on the FTX exchange puts Coinbase’s share price at about $634, which would imply a market value for the U.S. exchange north of $160 billion.  As CoinDesk reported previously, exchange tokens have skyrocketed since last year, sometimes traded as a crypto-native proxy for  equity in the companies behind the exchanges, arguably the industry’s top revenue-getters. Another exchange token, FTX’s own FTT,  has posted year-to-date gains of more than 800%, per Messari data.“By buying these exchange tokens, it may be a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ type of event, where things are going to run up so much in the next few days in anticipation” of the Coinbase listing, Frank said.Of course, with the extreme gains in BNB come major risks.Paramount among those, in a cryptocurrency industry where decentralization is prized, is that Binance is so centralized: BNB is owned and created by Binance, and the Binance team still owns over 80% of BNB, according to Mancini.It means that “there is a centralized authority to answer if regulators came knocking,” Mancini said. Contrast that with ether, which is fully open-source. “This regulatory risk can create a serious hurdle for BNB being listed on other exchanges, or being allowed to grow its utility on American or European soil.”Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari, also criticized BSC’s centralization in a recent tweet thread, arguing that BSC is just a “copycat” of Ethereum.“The reason why BSC is faster and more scalable is not because of some magical technological innovation,” Watkins wrote. “It’s instead the magic of centralization. BSC is an Ethereum fork with a centralized validator set. That’s it, nothing more.”However, hedge funds or even average crypto investors might not care about that too much, at least in the short term, The TIE’s Frank said.“The average consumer just wants a good user experience,” Frank said. Meanwhile, “if you are a hedge fund that’s trading and taking small-term positions or small-term bets, you also care a lot less about decentralization risks.”BNB’s low-price strategy also might eventually lose its competitive allure. “Eventually everyone reaches 0% fees on trades,” Mancini said. “Although BNB offers cheaper trading right now, eventually that benefit will go away.”",2021-04-13
3896,"Coinbase’s widely anticipated direct stock listing on Nasdaq continues to galvanize crypto-market interest as bitcoin’s price broke Tuesday to a new record high.At press time, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at $62,860.01, not far from the all-time high price of $63,707.34 reached earlier in the day, according to CoinDesk 20.Spot trading volume on eight crypto exchanges tracked by CoinDesk also rose on Tuesday, to near $4 billion at press time, the highest since April 7.The bullish sentiment is reflected on the bitcoin’s futures market, with the annualized premium between the BTC futures price and spot price now approaching 50% for three-month contracts. It’s seen as an indication that more futures traders are looking for upside.“Markets are positioning themselves for a direct listing that potentially values Coinbase at more than $100 billion,” Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin, said. “As a result, demand for bitcoin and crypto has never been higher.”Seemingly in lockstep with bitcoin, ether rallied Tuesday to new record high prices.But the star lately among altcoins might be BNB token, from the crypto exchange giant Binance.While exchange tokens in general have received a boost from comparisons with Coinbase, BNB’s rapid value increase may also have something to do with the success of Binance Smart Chain, an Ethereum alternatives launched by Binance. Total value locked on BSC now sits at around $30 billion, more than double over the last month, according to Arcane Research’s weekly newsletter Tuesday.“If this growth rate continues, it will not take long until Binance-based projects hold more value than Ethereum-based projects,” Arcane wrote.Other digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the green Tuesday.

3897,"It wasn’t always clear that Coinbase was going to be a profitable company in the long term.The crypto exchange set to list on Nasdaq on Wednesday had to husband its resources during the industry’s prosperous times to make it through the lean periods. “There have been a lot of moments in Coinbase’s past where the right person made the right call,” said Asiff Hirji, president of blockchain mortgage platform Figure and former Coinbase president and chief operating officer. “In the first crypto winter, they hung in there with their business model and saving enough cash to preserve through the winter. That’s an amazing call to make.” Hirji recalled planning for 2018. ""We had done a billion dollars in revenue in 2017 and said that next year we were planning on doing $500 million in revenue. [The board] was used to [feverlines moving] up and to the right and we told them ‘We are a highly volatile business.’ … We assumed that on Jan. 1, 2018, bitcoin would crash. We were only off by a quarter.”Bitcoin’s future was just as uncertain as the company’s own in the early days.“It was not clear that the cryptocurrency experiment would even work,” said Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first hire at Coinbase, now the CEO and founder of Polychain Capital. “Now we talk about market share in cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency competing with fintechs and things like that.

3898,"The asset management industry is now bifurcated. On one side, forward-thinking researchers have reached the conclusion that bitcoin has changed monetary technology as we know it. On the other is everybody else, whether ardently dismissing bitcoin or merely sitting on the sidelines.Let’s be honest, naysayers are having a tough go of it in 2021. Tired arguments equating bitcoin to tulip mania are obsolete, and even the most seasoned investment professionals who previously brushed off cryptocurrency are either getting involved or admitting they might have missed something. This is causing investment managers who simply don’t yet own bitcoin for clients, the sideline crowd, to feel extremely nervous right now. And it comes down to fiduciary duty.A fiduciary is somebody who has a legal obligation to take care of money on behalf of clients. The only remaining defendable excuse for an investment manager not yet allocating to bitcoin is price volatility. A fiduciary including bitcoin in a portfolio would launch the range of expected returns excessively wider than what was originally promised. A small 5% position in bitcoin could be extremely fruitful in a year like 2021 but cause massive underperformance in a year like 2018. In this thinking, the fiduciary has a duty to exclude bitcoin because of the potential negative impact on investment returns.But price volatility doesn’t necessarily equate to outright risk, and herein lies the complexity. Fiduciaries have a duty to exclude bitcoin from portfolios due to price volatility, but they are actually taking on an entirely separate risk hidden in plain sight: the failure to correctly identify monetary reality. The dollar might not cease to be the world’s most popular currency denomination in the near future, but the stampede of 100 million people converting at least part of their savings and their mental denomination to BTC is shaking the ground of every land mass on the planet. Those earthquakes resonate with a belief in bitcoin as a consensus mechanism used to determine what is money, or what is real. Now, saying that a fiduciary’s job is to identify an existential shift in monetary reality sounds like a stretch. However, fiduciaries focused on growth should recognize an asset that completed a decade of 200% compound annual growth. And if they haven’t, chances are they’ve started to underperform their peers.The underperformance should lead a diligent investor to ask questions about bitcoin and the technological and geopolitical shifts associated with an internet-based, non-government currency. What does your fiduciary duty require of you? Can you afford to be entirely without ownership of what a growing percentage of the world’s population consider an alternative, fully digital and stateless monetary regime? When looked at from that perspective, it might be your fiduciary duty to own bitcoin for your clients despite its price volatility.Here’s the correct thesis for investment managers asking these important questions in 2021: it’s time to own some bitcoin for clients. The base assumption for fiduciaries can no longer be a dollar-only future. The monetary and cryptography sciences have officially merged, and bitcoin has already achieved global reserve currency status. Not owning bitcoin is now the unhedged position. And in an era of financial instability, an unhedged position is ripe for disaster. Owning some bitcoin, even if in the smallest nominal amount, allows fiduciaries to demonstrate an understanding that the world’s denomination is slowly changing, not away from the dollar to the renminbi or euro, but away from a dependence on government-issued currencies. The change is subtle, especially with the global economy entirely reliant on the current monetary infrastructure. But those willing to read between the lines have already purchased bitcoin for their client whether they call it a hedge, speculative bet, or monetary revolution.There’s one final component to the argument for fiduciaries to allocate to bitcoin, and that’s human freedom. In the West, it’s incredibly easy to ignore bitcoin’s potential as a tool for financial empowerment – bitcoin receives demand from those looking to make a political statement against the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. But we live in a world with serious problems plaguing our planet, such as environmental destruction, human trafficking, and politically-caused inflation. Today, so many fiduciaries are not only responsible for investment performance but also for advancing corporate responsibility and positively influencing societal change – financial index publisher MSCI now provides ESG (environmental, social and governance) ratings for over 14,000 corporate issuers as sustainable investing is transforming the entire approach to investment management. With bitcoin acting as an alternative in inflation-ravaged countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Nigeria, it has the potential to alleviate human strife. Maybe after reading this article, fiduciaries might suppress their own fears of crypto-volatility to simultaneously pursue superior investment returns and social impact.",2021-04-13
