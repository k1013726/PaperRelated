0,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Ether is outperforming bitcoin as the CFTC reiterates it should be under its purview, and not the SEC's.Insights: The CFTC's lawsuit against Binance is part of the increasing regulator scrutiny that crypto is undergoing. Will the suit – and other enforcement actions – ultimately help Asia's crypto narrative?Ether Up on CFTC Remarks, Bitcoin Flat as Market Digests Binance Suit and Awaits Economic DataGood morning Asia.This week is proving to be a tumultuous one for news.First, Binance was sued by the CFTC over alleged regulatory violations regarding its derivatives products. Next, Sam Bankman-Fried faces another indictment regarding allegations of bribing officials in China, making some wonder if this will damp Beijing’s mood toward the asset class, and finally, to bring it back to the CFTC, its Chair Rostin Behnam reiterated Tuesday during a hearing that he believes ether is a commodity.How’s crypto reacting to this?Bitcoin is trading flat, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours to $27,302. Ether is up just under 4.3% to $1,778.Given that the CFTC reiterated once again, before Congress, that it believes ether is a commodity – and not a security like the SEC would have – tokens in its orbit are also well in the green.Staking provider Lido saw its token rise by over 12% to $45.81, and Lido staked ether is outperforming ether at on-day gains of 6.5%. Meanwhile, on-chain derivatives exchange GMX’s token is up by 8.7%, perhaps because traders are looking for derivatives infrastructure they believe is beyond the reach of the CFTC (though decentralization, historically, hasn’t been a great defense).Layer 1 and layer 2s are also in the green, with Solana at 3.5%, Polkadot at 3.6%, Cardano’s ADA at 6.6%, and Polygon at 4.3%.The CFTC Cracks Down. Will Asia Benefit?The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Monday action against Binance was a surprise to some and an annoyance to many.Sure, traders who use Binance, like the U.S.-based prop shops with offshore accounts, holders of its BNB token, are some of the people who are annoyed.But more importantly, it's those who want the U.S. to develop a comprehensive framework for crypto and stop ruling by enforcement.In 2020, calendar years ago but centuries in crypto time, U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer (R - Minnesota) introduced the Securities Clarity Act, which sought to create a new legal category called “investment contract asset.”“This new term would refer to any asset sold as part of an investment contract that would not be considered a ‘security’ but for its sale as part of an investment contract,” was how it was described in a September 2020 statement on Emmer’s website.Effectively, it was a framework for crypto similar to what the Monetary Authority of Singapore has developed, or what authorities in Hong Kong and Taiwan are also working on: rules made in the 2020s for an asset class of the internet era, not relying on an interpretation of a court case from 1946.“The fact remains that digital assets like cryptocurrencies do not fit neatly into the SEC’s regulatory framework,” Bo Howell, an Ohio-based securities lawyer, wrote in a January 2022 post explaining the contested authority over crypto.Instead, we have regulation by enforcement. Attempts to dictate things via court rulings, not a rulebook to which all parties have access.In March, Coinbase asked for just that: rule-making.As part of a legal proceeding concerning an ex-Coinbase staff member accused of insider trading, the SEC is attempting to establish a comprehensive definition for securities that encompasses the majority of cryptocurrency tokens, by pursuing securities fraud allegations against the former employee.“The SEC’s suit rests on the erroneous premise that the seven Coinbase-listed assets identified in its complaint are ‘securities.’ But Coinbase does not list any securities on its platform,” an amicus brief Coinbase filed as part of the case in March reads. “The SEC posits that the digital assets qualify as securities because they are “investment contract[s], but the assets lack both essential attributes of that statutory term: They are neither contracts nor investments.”Something similar happened in December. The SEC made the case that FTX's exchange token, FTT, is a security as part of a complaint against FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. The duo are pleading guilty and looking to cooperate with authorities, meaning the SEC's allegations won't be tested in the adversarial environment of a courtroom.The SEC hasn’t given Coinbase – or any other exchange – anything close to the rulebook they've asked for. There’s no official code to read; lawyers instead have to interpret court filings and read the tea leaves on possible interpretations.“This ongoing and ever-changing regulatory environment hinders well-designed compliance and regulatory plans,” Braden Perry, a former attorney for the CFTC, said in a 2020 interview.His analysis still holds true today.“The last thing any industry wants is what the SEC and CFTC have done: regulation by enforcement, in which agencies decide that some practices should have been illegal, [and then] go back and prosecute the people who were doing it before,” he continued.In a January 2023 interview with CoinDesk, Rep. Emmer said that more legislation is coming. The right kind, hopefully, and not the stuff that drives an industry offshore.“We’re going to focus obviously on legislation, and I think it’s going to be to place key guardrails around the industry,” Emmer said. “Market structure guardrails. Stablecoin guardrails. Things like that.”Right now, this seems bullish for Asia. China’s state-owned banks are soliciting crypto business in Hong Kong, something that would be unheard of or even considered absurd for its sheer unlikeliness if mentioned years ago.But this is crypto. Stuff moves fast. Can America keep up? Maybe it's not a bad thing if the industry moves to Asia.Metaverse Fashion Week (Decentraland) 8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:30 UTC) Australia Monthly Consumer Price Index (YoY/Feb)10:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(14:00 UTC) United States Pending Home Sales (MoM/Feb)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Former CFTC Chair Massad Reacts to CFTC Case Against Binance; Bitcoin DropsThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued crypto exchange Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao on Monday on allegations that the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law.

1,"Stacks (STX), the native token of Stacks Network, has soared in March amid booming hype for Bitcoin Ordinals and growing total value locked (TVL) on the protocol. The project is also set to undergo an upgrade later this year to further speed and scalability.Known for being the first token distributed through the first-ever U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) qualified token offering in 2019, STX has gained 23% in March, reaching $1.25, the token’s highest level since a year ago. Although the token's gains have slowed slightly toward the end of March, it is still up 350% over the last three months, bringing its valuation to $1.5 billion.Looking at tokens with a market capitalization above $1 billion, STX is the second top-performing digital asset over the month of March, behind XRP, according to data from Messari.Stacks is a Bitcoin layer 2 protocol for smart contracts that’s attempting to transform and extend Bitcoin’s functionality from its widely known role as an alternative payment system to a more versatile platform that is programmable.The token began to climb last month amid market participants' growing interest in creating Bitcoin Ordinal non-fungible tokens (NFT). Stacks has a native functionality to mint NFTs, and users have minted 650,000 Bitcoin NFTs on the Stacks layer 2, according to Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali.Stacks Network’s TVL also spiked over the last few months, climbing from $8 million in February to $35 million in mid-March, according to data from DeFiLlama. It has since retreated to $25 million.“The hype surrounding Stacks is definitely due to Ordinals but could be sustained if the devs stick around,” decentralized finance (DeFi) analyst Michael Nadeau said. “Bitcoin needs projects like this to sustain itself in the long run.”The Stacks smart contract protocol has a ledger to store data outside of Bitcoin’s layer 1, enabling developers to build apps on the platform, similar to what they can do on Ethereum or Solana.Stacks is aiming to make Bitcoin more programmable, a feature more associated with the other two blockchain platforms, which currently have the majority of DeFi activity.Stacks’ Ali said in an interview with CoinDesk that the recent interest surrounding STX could partly stem from anticipation for Stacks’ upcoming Nakamoto upgrade later this year.He said the release will give users access to full smart contracts on a layer 2 chain, enabling them to move bitcoin (BTC) in and out while their layer 2 transactions are secured by the Bitcoin layer 1 network.Ali said that unlike Ethereum and Arbitrum, users can’t easily move BTC into the Stacks layer right now. This is the biggest bottleneck.The update is set to increase the network’s liquidity and capacity.Ali also explained that unlike a lot of blockchains that require high-power hardware to run nodes, Stacks allows users to run nodes on less-sophisticated hardware such as Raspberry Pi or normal laptops, making it more accessible for users. Unlike Solana or ICP, Stacks doesn’t require you to run nodes in data centers, which is the typical way to deploy nodes with high hardware requirements, according to Ali.In a report, NorthRock Digital, a hedge fund that invests in cryptocurrencies, wrote that “despite limitations developing a crypto economy on top of Bitcoin, Stacks has a potentially 'massive opportunity' ... because of the relatively small crypto economy currently built on Bitcoin.NorthRock identified three main layer 2 networks on Bitcoin: Lightning, RSK and Stacks. Each layer 2 “is complementary and has different goals, but of the three Stacks is furthest along in terms of developing an ecosystem for more traditional crypto applications (NFTs, DeFi, Name Services, etc.),” NorthRock wrote.NorthRock also noted that Bitcoin’s upcoming halving will likely benefit Stacks. “The halving itself will decrease Bitcoin’s security budget and further reinforce the need to develop a larger fee pool through a more productive Bitcoin ecosystem. This will solidify the importance” of layer 2s like Stacks, the report said."
2,"Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated around $27,000 as investors continued to mull the potential impact of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao over alleged regulatory violations including running an illegal exchange and a ""sham"" compliance program.BTC was recently trading at about $27,225, up about 1% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dipped as low as $26,669 earlier in the day. BTC plunged from highs above $28,000 after the CFTC lawsuit was filed on Monday and has fallen 3% over the past week.“Bitcoin is displaying such unbelievable resilience to what is happening around it, even in the crypto industry, that you have to wonder just how sustainable that can be,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Tuesday note. He added that the CFTC-Binance-triggered price drop “doesn't feel particularly significant.”Investors are fretful about the potential impact of the CFTC suit against the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, and increasing regulatory scrutiny that threatens to place some of the same restrictions on the industry as on traditional finance.Meanwhile, Binance and the CFTC sparred in the aftermath of the filing. In a late Monday blog post, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao called the lawsuit “an incomplete recitation of facts.” But in an appearance on CNBC on Tuesday, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said the CFTC action “seemed to be a pretty clear case of evasion and something that we needed to step in aggressively with and do it as quickly as possible.”K33 Research’s research analysts also attributed the recent downside volatility to lingering effects of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 25 basis point interest rate hike last week and software provider MicroStrategy’s announcement on Monday that it had bought roughly $150 million more in bitcoin over the past five weeks and pre-paid the remaining principle on a loan from failed, crypto-focused Silvergate Bank. BTC fell 2% in the immediate aftermath.“The adverse market reaction after a MicroStrategy announcement is typical,” K33's research analysts wrote in a note sent to its client Tuesday. “Market participants absorb the information that a known large buyer has finished, meaning less buy-side liquidity to support further upside.”Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value, was recently changing hands at about $1,772, a nearly 4% gain. Crypto payment platform Ripple’s XRP token price jumped over 10% Tuesday to 52 cents, its highest level in five months.The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures the overall crypto market performance, recently rose 1.6%.Equity markets turned red Tuesday amid banking uncertainties, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq trading down 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 0.3%."
3,"An on-chain measure of stablecoins versus bitcoin (BTC) held by exchanges indicates the appetite for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could be waning.The Exchange Stablecoins Ratio (ESR), an indicator that divides bitcoin exchange reserves by the number of stablecoins on exchanges, has risen to its highest level since May 2021.The CryptoQuant metric acts as a measure of buying power. When the ESR declines, the number of stablecoins on exchange is increasing relative to bitcoin reserves. When the ratio increases, the opposite is the case.As stablecoins serve as a primary mechanism for purchasing crypto assets, a lower ratio equates to more buying power.The recent increase in the ratio implies that investors are moving fewer stablecoins to exchanges and more bitcoin, or they are doing both simultaneously.Both would indicate potential selling pressure as investors fret about the current investment environment following several U.S. bank failures and increased regulatory scrutiny of crypto. Investors often move crypto assets to exchanges for the purpose of selling. They move stablecoins to exchanges when bullish sentiment is increasing.The timing of the relative decline in stablecoin supply coincides with a 34% increase in BTC's price since March 10, but that was largely before conditions worsened.Theoretically, if investors felt that more gains were to be had following a price increase, the stablecoin volume to exchanges would increase.The sharp increase in the ratio following bitcoin’s price increase implies investors at the very least have positioned themselves to take profits quickly, should an event cause the bitcoin’s price to drop suddenly.An example of such an event was the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation (CFTC) lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The filing was followed by a big BTC price drop in the ensuing hours.BTC fell 2.84% on Monday, and is most recently down an additional 0.55%..A second on-chain indicator is signaling investor caution as well. The Adjusted Spent Output Profit (aSOPR) ratio measures the extent to which bitcoin investors are selling at a profit or loss.The metric indicates that investors are selling at a profit when its reading exceeds 1.0, and that investors are selling at a loss when it falls below 1.0.The current reading of 1.0452 indicates the former. While selling an asset at a profit is generally viewed positively, taking profits in the middle of an increase in asset prices could signal concerns that the increase will stall."
4,"The crypto Fear and Greed index, a metric that aims to measure current sentiment in the market, dipped to 59 on Tuesday, sliding from a nearly 18-month high of 68 reached one week ago, according to data from alternative.me.Readings above 50 indicate market sentiment has moved into the ""greed"" stage, while those below 50 indicate ""fear."" The index hadn't been as high as 68 since November 2021 when bitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time record above $69,000.Although the gauge has declined since last week to 59, it remains in the ""greed"" zone, suggesting investor sentiment for now remains bullish.Throughout most of 2022, the index was stuck in the ""fear"" and ""extreme fear"" territories for good reason. Crypto prices collapsed during a wave of bad news and bankruptcies in the industry.The rebound to ""greed"" in 2023 came as crypto prices bounced despite a growing number of regulatory crackdowns and macroeconomic fears. Bitcoin was recently just shy of $27,000 after starting the year around $16,500.“Bitcoin is displaying such unbelievable resilience to what is happening around it, even in the crypto industry,” wrote Craig Erlam, senior analyst at Oanda, in a market note. He added that it’s important to wonder how sustainable this can be in the longer term.The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is suing crypto exchange Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao on allegations the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law. Bitcoin dropped about 3% following the news.“While bitcoin did fall a few percent in response to reports that the CFTC is suing Binance, the drop doesn't feel particularly significant,” said Erlam, “especially in light of the gains we've seen in recent weeks and this year as a whole.“Of course, that isn't to say it's suddenly going to plunge but it will no doubt be interesting to see how it performs over the coming weeks, especially if further turbulence is coming for the industry.”"
5,"Binance USD (BUSD), a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, endured over $500 million in outflows in the roughly 24 hours since a U.S. lawsuit was filed against Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao, data from CryptoQuant shows.This rush to the exits is quite a bit smaller than that seen following the February crackdown on New York-based BUSD issuer Paxos by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice of potential action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Binance at that time processed over $2 billion in BUSD outflows.Some analysts pointed to Binance’s decision to shift towards other stablecoins as a key reason behind the relatively soft impact on BUSD over the past day. The exchange ended zero-fee trading for BUSD-listed trading pairs on March 22, moving them over to trueUSD (TUSD)-listed pairs instead.“It might be due to the fact that Binance was preparing for the transition from BUSD to an alternative stablecoin such as TUSD or USDC,” CryptoQuant head of marketing Hochan Chung told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.“Also, the changes in Binance's exchange reserves of [bitcoin], [ether] and other stablecoins are not notably significant,"" Chung added. ""Only the BNB price has been damaged (down 5.78% in the past 24 hours) from the issue,” Chung added. BNB is the exchange token of Binance.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Monday sued crypto exchange Binance and founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao on allegations the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law.Zhao has since stated the company did not agree with the characterization of many of the issues, and touted the exchange’s compliance technology.The filing caused tremors in the crypto markets, however, with bitcoin falling 3% in the past 24 hours and Binance-related BNB tokens falling as much as 5% before a modest recovery.BUSD, however, has shown signs of resilience despite the turbulence. The token has maintained its dollar peg and had only slightly above-average outflows of over $500 million. There have been no unforeseen incidents concerning BUSD that have taken place on BNB chain-based decentralized finance applications, in which the stablecoin plays a huge role.CORRECTION (March 28, 2023 15:05 UTC): New York State banking regulators were involved in the Paxos crackdown."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued crypto exchange Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao on Monday on allegations the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law. The lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleged that Binance operated a derivatives trading operation in the U.S., offering trades for cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ether, litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and binance USD (BUSD), all of which the suit referred to as commodities. The suit also alleges that the company, under Zhao’s leadership, directed its employees to spoof their locations through the use of virtual private networks.In a blog post Monday, Zhao said that the lawsuit contained “an incomplete recitation of facts,” saying that “we do not agree with the characterization of many of the issues alleged in the complaint” and calling the complaint “unexpected and disappointing.” Zhao touted the exchange giant’s compliance technology, including its know-your-customer program. He wrote that the exchange had 750 people in its compliance teams, “many with prior law enforcement and regulatory agency backgrounds,” and noted that the company had 16 licenses and registrations worldwide.Bitcoin sank below $27,000 following news of the lawsuit, dropping to its lowest level since March 17. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is down 5% in the past 24 hours to about $26,700. Binance coin (BNB) declined by 5%. Matteo Bottacini, a trader at Crypto Finance AG, wrote in a morning note that investors are taking long positions in ether and other altcoins and short positions in bitcoin. “My bias is that upside for BTC looks now limited to the $30Ks while ETH and most of the altcoins are still waiting for the exploit,” he wrote. “Similarly, on the way down, despite BTC being the mega-cap here, I can easily see it trading in the $25k-$22.5k range.”"
7,"Poor liquidity, a problem plaguing crypto markets since the collapse of the FTX exchange in November, could worsen, breeding price volatility as regulators go after dominant exchange Binance.On Monday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance for running an alleged ""illegal exchange"" and a ""sham"" compliance program. The regulator, which is responsible for oversight of commodities and derivatives markets, including the derivatives tied to bitcoin (BTC), sued Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and former top compliance executive Samuel Lim, alleging ""willful evasion"" of the U.S. law.Binance has long been the leading digital assets exchange and accounted for a much bigger share of the global trading volumes than its former rival FTX. Per Morgan Stanley, the exchange accounted for 81% of the total BTC traded on centralized exchanges in February. According to the case document, a single trader from Chicago is responsible for 12% of the total trading volume on Binance.Observers, therefore, are worried the lawsuit would bring a deeper decline in the market liquidity – a measure of how difficult or easy it is to trade large quantities at stable prices.""The main worry is what this will do short-term to market liquidity. If market makers step back from trading on Binance now, and if Binance's U.S.-based trading desks have to stop operations, that will reduce liquidity in an already thin market,"" Noelle Acheson, the author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said.""That will exacerbate volatility and could keep some large players on the sidelines for a while longer,"" Acheson added.Liquidity is widely measured by a metric called the 2% market depth – a collection of the buy and sell orders within 2% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices.The greater the market depth, the less likely that large buy/sell orders will cause significant deviations in the asset's market price. Market makers are entities that provide liquidity to a financial market by creating buy and sell orders that aren't executed immediately.Bitcoin's 2% market depth slipped to a 10-month low last week, extending the deterioration seen since FTX's sister firm Alameda Research, formerly one of the largest market makers, closed shop five months ago.The situation will persist for a while, according to DRW-subsidiary Cumberland, one of the earliest and longest-standing crypto market makers.""This lawsuit will certainly exacerbate tightness in the already-strained digital asset banking system, and as a knock-on effect, it will damage liquidity,"" Cumberland said in a tweet explaining the impact of the regulatory action on the market.Some observers expect bitcoin to revisit the former resistance-turned-support near $25,000 in the wake of the heightened regulatory uncertainty.""It is clear that the CFTC wants oversight on all crypto exchanges. It's not something new, but the market is reacting prudently and we are still holding our breath for further negative news, which may push BTC down,"" Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, told CoinDesk.""Long rekts [liquidations], which increased [Monday], will inevitably push prices down, possibly below support near $25,000,"" Kssis added.Bitcoin fell by over 3% on Monday, hitting lows near $26,500 in response to the CFTC's action against Binance. The cryptocurrency has since stabilized around $27,000, having put in a nine-month high of $28,889 on March 23, CoinDesk data shows.Derivatives exchanges on Monday liquidated or forced closed bullish long futures positions worth more than $25 million, a sharp rise from Sunday's $3.6 million figure, according to Glassnode. Meanwhile, short liquidations amounted to just $7 million. Forced closures of long/short positions often add to bearish/bullish pressures around the cryptocurrency.According to Acheson, the lawsuit is not good news for market valuation because it adds ""yet another layer of uncertainty and is not a good 'look' for the ecosystem, coming soon after another high-profile fraud.""Acheson, however, expects recent macroeconomic developments such as increased expectations for a quick Federal Reserve pivot in favor of interest rate cuts to cushion markets from the negative impact of the Binance news.""For BTC, [ether] and other majors, we're seeing some selling interest that is supported by buyers coming in. This is a very different market than November, with a pivot in sight and new narratives motivating new types of investment decisions,"" Acheson noted. ""Psychologically, it's not as much a blow as the FTX implosion since the market has been warned repeatedly that something like this was coming."""
8,"XRP tokens surged 8% over the past 24 hours to buck a market-wide decline following a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filing against prominent crypto exchange Binance.XRP traded just under 50 cents in Asian morning hours on Tuesday, reaching a five-month high. Its XRP Ledger network has seen fundamental upgrades in the past few months that may have contributed to the rise.However, a part of the bullish outlook came as some in the community said the classification of major tokens as a commodity in the CFTC filing against Binance could mean XRP tokens were, too, commodities instead of a security, as alleged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the ongoing Ripple v. SEC case.Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz has previously made the case for XRP tokens as a commodity. “XRP is a raw good that trades in commerce and one XRP is treated as equivalent to every other XRP. That's pretty much the definition of a ""commodity,” Schwartz said in a January tweet.“No part of XRP's value comes from anyone else's legal obligations to XRP holders,” he said at the time.Ripple has historically maintained a distance from its relation to XRP, the token that powers some of Ripple’s products and the XRP Ledger network. Any progression in the case causes XRP price movement, however.Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao were sued Monday as the CFTC alleges Binance offered unregistered crypto derivatives products and directed U.S. customers to evade compliance controls through the use of virtual privacy networks (VPN).The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on Monday, alleges Binance operates a derivatives trading operation in the U.S., offering trades for cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD), which the lawsuit referred to as commodities.Bitcoin fell below $27,000, losing a local support level, while ether briefly dropped under $1,700 before recovering. Overall market capitalization fell nearly 3%, CoinGecko data shows.Markets slumped almost immediately – but some market observers found optimism in the fact that tokens mentioned in the CFTC filing were commodities and not securities.Alarm bells in the broader crypto community were sounded last month as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was rumored to be cracking down on staking-as-a-service products, or protocols that pay rewards to users who lock up token holdings for a specified amount of time."
9,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin is hovering around $27,000 after the CFTC takes action against Binance.Insights: The Hong Kong branches of China's state-run banks want crypto. Now for the hard part.It's the CFTC vs. LiquidityGood morning. Bitcoin is starting the Asia business day down 3.8% to $26,958 after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued crypto exchange Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, alleging it offered unregistered crypto derivatives in the U.S.Binance’s BNB token is down 5.9% to $308 on the allegations.The question on the traders' minds is how much of a going concern Binance is now that the CFTC has struck this blow. On the one hand, Binance’s CEO called the CFTC complaint “unexpected and disappointing,” yet, in February, the exchange said it is prepared to pay monetary penalties to “make amends” for sins of the past.At the same time, there is some debate about how much traders are shrugging off the CFTC’s allegations versus how much bitcoin has an ability to react to news because of a lack of liquidity.“When you have low liquidity, you tend to get very quiet markets,” Dan Gunsberg, co-founder of Solana-based derivatives liquidity protocol Hxro, said during a recent CoinDesk TV appearance. “You get these jumps in the market and these liquidity vacuums, where things move to a new price and immediately settle down again.”At the same time as the CFTC goes after Binance, the decentralization narrative continues.Decentralized derivatives exchange GMX's token rose by 4% during the last 24 hours, almost in parallel to how tokens of decentralized ether liquid staking platforms rose in February when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took aim at staking.But just because something is decentralized, doesn’t mean regulators can’t go after it.China Banks' Push for Hong Kong Crypto Business Faces HeadwindsChina’s state-owned banks’ Hong Kong branches – semi-autonomous entities that operate under Hong Kong's rules – are actively soliciting crypto business, in anticipation of the first phase of the Special Administrative Region's regulatory framework in June. But opening an account with them is another thing altogether.Bloomberg reported Monday that the banks making the pitches have gotten the green light from Beijing, and their respective headquarters.Sources from multiple crypto companies in Hong Kong that had either been pitched by the banks’ sales representatives, or made inbound inquiries, all say that the criteria for opening an account is burdensome and the know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) process is longer than opening a regular business account.For instance, banks prefer that executives and key personnel at the crypto company reside in Hong Kong. A definite blocker would be if they are mainland Chinese nationals or U.S. citizens. If the company is owned by a Singapore-based parent, that firm would need to be a licensed entity by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.Sources were also told to expect a long account-opening process.Is it really progress?These banks, such as Bank of China and Bank of Communications, are some of the world’s largest, and it’d be unthinkable a few years ago that they would be actively soliciting crypto business considering Beijing’s hardline stance on the issue and the general hesitation of large banks to engage with crypto.After all, in the U.S., Silvergate and Signature found their market niche for this exact reason, with analysts saying the crypto industry will have a “difficult time finding traditional banks that will work with it” post their demise. These two banks made – and lost – their fortune with crypto: At the turn of the decade, they were both small, unknown banks before embracing crypto; Silvergate reported $2.12 billion in assets in December 2019 and peaked at $16 billion in December 2021.Although both Silvergate and Signature grew significantly throughout crypto’s boom years and institutionalization, their relatively small size means that they fell faster than they would have if they were larger like some of their peers.But not everyone thinks this is the first chapter of something new, considering the tough onboarding process.""The city’s digital assets regulation is overall friendly and encourages banks to work with crypto companies, however, banks still currently have stringent requirements in place which makes it difficult for crypto businesses to expand and grow,” Adrian Wang, founder and CEO of Metalpha, a Hong Kong-based digital assets wealth management company, said to CoinDesk. “We have yet to see major progress in the banking sector to embrace crypto. Hopefully, that will change soon.”12:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(4:00 UTC) Bank of Japan's Governor Kuroda Speech9:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:15 UTC) European Central Bank's President Lagarde Speech10:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(14:00 UTC) United States Consumer Confidence (March)In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:First Citizens to Buy Much of Silicon Valley Bank; Cathie Wood's ARK Invest Buys More CoinbaseA deal has been finalized for what’s left of Silicon Valley Bank.

10,"Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below $27,000 after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao over allegations that the exchange knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S., a violation of federal law.The BTC/USD trading pair on the Coinbase exchange dropped to $26,525, its lowest point since March 17, data from TradingView showed. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $26,978, down 3.1% in the past 24 hours.“As far as I can see the crypto community is putting this news on the 'here we go again' pile,” Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, told CoinDesk.Kempenaer said the Binance-CFTC lawsuit “very likely” sent BTC's price lower. However, he added that the lawsuit’s “implications are unclear,” even as it offered the latest example of increased regulatory scrutiny, a trend that the industry will continue to monitor closely. He said that bitcoin might fall to its previous breakout level near $25,000.""As long as that level holds, the break from a long-term bottoming formation is still in play,"" he said. But he added that “taking out heavy overhead resistance range between $29,000 and $32,000 will free up the way for a much stronger move higher.""Monday’s Binance-CFTC news caught traders who bet on a price gain off-guard. They liquidated some $39 million worth of BTC’s long positions, according to data from Coinglass.In the lawsuit against Binance filed in U.S. District Court in Illinois, the CFTC called several cryptos including BTC, ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD) commodities. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has previously suggested that proof-of-stake tokens are securities.ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency, fell below $1,700 before recently rebounding to $1,703, still off 3.6% from Sunday, same time. BNB, the native token of the Binance-initiated blockchain network BNB Chain, has declined by over 5% to about $310 from roughly $327 a day ago. Litecoin (LTC) was trading down nearly 4.8%.The regulatory unclarity is a “concerning” factor for moving the markets, especially the specific allegations contained within the CFTC suit, according to Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, told CoinDesk.""Binance is by far the largest crypto exchange in the world and thus has an outsized impact on markets,"" Carey said, although he added that the drop in markets hasn't been ""too severe,"" given the importance of this regulatory news.Some crypto-related stocks also dropped. Shares of exchange Coinbase (COIN) and bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) slid by 8% and 6%, respectively.Equity markets were mixed Monday afternoon as investors weighed the announcement that regional lender First Citizens BancShares would buy most of the business of Silicon Valley Bank. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose by 0.4 and 0.8%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 0.1%."
11,"Asset managers’ appetite for bitcoin (BTC) appears to have increased over the last week, a sign that larger investors continue to see value in the asset.The most recent Commitment of Traders (COT) report shows that asset managers increased their open long positions by 975 contracts as of March 21. This marks a reversal from the prior three weeks, where asset managers reduced their longs by a total of 1,482 contracts.COT data is released weekly by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and details the positions and open interest of traders of bitcoin futures contracts into “Dealer/Intermediary,” “Asset Manager/Institutional” and “Leveraged Funds” categories.Asset managers now comprise 49.1% of open long positions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), up from 44% the week prior. The increased bitcoin exposure has come after prices for the asset increased 15% from March 14-21, and indicates positive sentiment among institutional investors, although the CFTC's lawsuit on Monday against exchange giant Binance could change their perspective.Still, asset managers with reportable positions are now 96.60% long bitcoin. This figure has risen to as high as 99% in prior COT reports.It will be important to view subsequent reports to determine if the increased bullishness continues, or if asset managers reduce exposure.Traders are likely to continue monitoring BTC reaction following the filing of the CFTC lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao.The suit alleges that the defendants knowingly disregarded provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act while engaging in a calculated strategy of regulatory arbitrage to their commercial benefit. Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume.The price of BTC fell as low as $26,670 following the announcement, before recovering a portion of the loss in the subsequent trading hour. Hourly trading volume spiked to more than 390% of its average as the asset immediately sold off.Bitcoin as an asset is a separate entity from Binance as an exchange, but the CFTC’s announcement may have stoked liquidity concerns among current BTC holders, particularly if they trade via Binance.While the CFTC action may be troublesome for Binance, larger investors may view bitcoin's decline as an opportunity to acquire the asset at a discount."
12,"Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, recorded its lowest bitcoin (BTC) trading volume on Sunday since July 4, 2022, according to data from Kaiko.Volume for 13 trading pairs, which once accounted for roughly half of the exchange’s volume, has dropped to about 30%. The exchange’s global market share, which peaked at over 70%, has dropped to about 58%.Average volumes of the BTC-USDT trading pair have plummeted 90%, Kaiko noted.The declines come after the exchange halted its no-fee trading promotion for the 13 bitcoin spot trading pairs, including BTC-USDT, on March 22. Binance called the promotion temporary. In an email to CoinDesk last week, Clara Medalie, research director at Kaiko, wrote that without zero-fee, she expected “a short-term drop in market share.”Binance’s zero-fee trading promotion on July 8 increased volume for both tether USD (USDT) and binance USD (BUSD) and helped Binance increase its market share to 72% from 50%, according to Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey.As of mid-March, zero-fee trade volume accounted for 66% of Binance’s trading volume.Binance phased out zero-fee trading last week, with the exception of the trueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin. “It is unclear why Binance has chosen to promote its TUSD pair, although it appears the exchange has selected the stablecoin as a successor to BUSD, which is being phased out because of regulatory actions in the U.S,” the report from Kaiko said.Before zero fees started, Binance’s trading market share for the 13 BTC pairs was just 25% before more than doubling. “It has now been just 5 days since fees were reinstated, and market share has halved and is currently below 30%,” Kaiko said.Binance’s global market share is down 10% since last week. The exchange suffered a two hour outage last week, the result of a computer bug that forced it to suspend spot market trading and could have contributed to the drop.In recent weeks, Binance has also endured increased regulatory scrutiny. On Monday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued the exchange and founder Changpeng Zhao on allegations the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. against federal law.Read More: CFTC Sues Binance, CZ Over 'Willful Evasion' of U.S. Laws, Unregistered Crypto Derivatives ProductsMarket share of tether-USD on the exchange has dropped from 81% to 68%, but TUSD volumes have had a small increase, climbing to $5 million. The BTC-TUSD pair, however, accounts for only 2.8% of the exchange's total volume."
13,"Stocks of crypto companies fell Monday after the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) sued Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, and CEO Changpeng Zhao.Coinbase (COIN), the only U.S. publicly traded crypto exchange, fell 9.1% as of 15:25 UTC (11:25 a.m. ET). Shares of bitcoin mining companies Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) all slid more than 7%. MicroStrategy (MSTR) – which earlier Monday disclosed the purchase of nearly another 6,500 bitcoin – was down 6.7%.Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, lost $1,000 to below $27,000. Binance's exchange token, BNB fell 3.3%.Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on Monday, the CTFC's lawsuit alleged that Binance knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. contrary to federal law.The company, said the CFTC, operated a derivatives trading operation in the U.S., offering trades for numerous cryptocurrencies, all of which the CFTC said are commodities. The suit also alleged that Binance, under Zhao’s leadership, directed its employees to spoof their locations through the use of virtual private networks."

Bloomberg had initially reported that a deal was nearing completion and could be announced as early as Monday morning. In a statement, the FDIC said that all depositors of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, the bridge bank set up by the FDIC after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, will automatically become depositors of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co. (FCNCO). All deposits assumed by First Citizens Bank, a regional bank based in Raleigh, N.C., will continue to be insured by the FDIC up to the insurance limit. As of March 10, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank reported roughly $167 billion in assets and nearly $119 billion in deposits.The crypto market managed to hold its ground over the weekend, with bitcoin up 1% over the past 24 hours to about $27,900. The cryptocurrency stayed in a range of between $27,000 and $28,000 throughout the weekend after reaching almost $30,000 early last week. Simon Peters, an analyst at trading platform eToro, said in a note Monday that a short-term pullback is possible. Ether was down slightly in the past 24 hours to about $1,700. European stocks opened higher on Monday as investors hope for an end to banking volatility. U.S. equity futures also edged higher.Cathy Wood's Ark Invest bought $12.6 million of Coinbase (COIN) shares on Friday, the second straight day the investment firm purchased the crypto exchange's stock after the company received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 22, sending the shares tumbling 16% the next day. The stock gained 1.5% on Friday to $67.83. According to an email sent Friday night, 155,833 shares went to ARK Innovation EFT (ARKK), and 26,395 shares went to ARK Next Generation Internet EFT (ARKW). The Wells Notice was a warning from the SEC that it believes Coinbase violated investor-protection laws and could be a signal that the SEC will sue the company."
15,"Expectations of increased U.S. dollar liquidity to support the banking sector following a string of forced closures has helped bitcoin (BTC) rally, but other factors are also at play, Morgan Stanley said in a research report Sunday.Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has gained 69% year-to-date.“Bitcoin trading order book liquidity is at the lowest level in a year, meaning lower volumes can drive larger price moves than before,” analysts led by Sheena Shah wrote.Traders on Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, now set the daily price for bitcoin with its share of trading volume reaching 80%, the report said.Issuance of the largest stablecoin, tether (USDT), has risen 10% in the last month and 16% this year, but that hasn’t been enough to offset the reduction in other stablecoins such as binance USD (BUSD) and USD coin (USDC), the note said.A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, usually the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins flows are indicative of money entering or leaving the crypto ecosystem.Morgan Stanley noted that over half of total tether issuance – and 70% of recent issuance – is on the Tron blockchain. Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Tron founder Justin Sun and his companies for fraud. Exchanges Kraken and Binance appear to be the main recipients of the new USDT, the note added.Read more: U.S. Banking Crisis Could Present an Opportunity for Some Crypto Exchanges: JPMorgan"
16,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:Prices: Bitcoin is beginning the week testing $28,000, but a consolidation at $25K is within the realm of possibility.Insights: Decentralized derivatives platforms are short of liquidity. What's in store for them?Happy Monday. Bitcoin is starting the Asia business day up 1.7%, just below $28K at $27,966. Ether is slightly outperforming bitcoin, beginning the day up 1.8% at $1,777.Speaking with CoinDesk TV on Friday, Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya said the success of Coinbase is dictating much of the future price movement of crypto.“Crypto traders are closely following everything with Coinbase. ​ Coinbase CEO [Brian] Armstrong noted that they weren't entirely surprised by the [Securities and Exchange Commission Wells] Notice. No one knows how regulators are going to rule if all tokens are securities,” he said. “Coinbase's success is vital for longer-term crypto growth. In the U.S., Coinbase is a critical option for how people are getting started with crypto.”Moya pointed out that while bitcoin has so far been unable to test the $30,000 level, it seems like it’s ready for a consolidation phase.Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in an email that the market has remained largely bullish after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) pushed out a relatively tame interest rate hike.“While we did expect a correction to $25K that didn't happen, we believe it is still in play. For now, the bulls will want to see bitcoin respecting $25K and consolidating above that level,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “Given some time with such price action, we may see altcoins starting to rally again. On the flipside, a breakdown of $25K could put the breaks on this rally.”All the while, ether traders are breathing a side of relief – and pushing up the price – after the latest decentralized finance (DeFi) crisis, this time involving protocol Euler Finance, seems to be coming to a close.CoinDesk reported over the weekend that the hacker behind Euler Finance’s $200 million exploit has returned the majority of the funds stolen from the protocol.Tokens associated with layer 1 protocols such as Solana and Eos took the news favorably, beginning the Asia business day in the green.Decentralized Derivatives' Exchanges Liquidity ProblemLiquidity is a big concern in today’s crypto market. Without market depth, large orders create price slippage and extreme price fluctuations capsize traders.The liquidity crisis has often been talked about in the context of bitcoin. Kaiko’s research team has flagged that a lack of fiat payment rails post-shutdown of Silvergate and Signature banks has dropped bitcoin’s liquidity to 10-month lows. But decentralized finance (DeFi) is also facing its own liquidity crunch.One of the most interesting developments in DeFi has been decentralized derivatives exchanges (DEX). For centralized exchanges, derivatives are a much larger – and more lucrative – market than spot trading, but this comes with enhanced interest from regulators. At the same time, DEXs are far more efficient operations than their centralized counterparts, which makes them worth the regulatory risk for investors.Perpetual futures DEX dYdX was first to the decentralized derivatives vertical, and by all accounts has done very well. But it’s not purely decentralized, combining a hybrid of a centralized order book with decentralized custody.The collapse of FTX was a booster shot of interest; on-chain transparency is the best antidote for dishonesty and it's impossible to hide things like funds co-mingling on the open book of blockchain.But dYdX’s competitors are running out of liquidity, leading to questions if the whole concept can scale.On Friday, Kwenta only had $1.27 million in open interest available for long positions on bitcoin perpetuals, and $450,000 in open interest available on the short side. The situation wasn't much better for ether, with only $1.64 million in open interest available for longs.GMX was in a better state, but has limited liquidity available for shorts, which can range from just over $1,000 up to around $700,000.In a December report, TokenInsight flagged the issue of liquidity as being detrimental to the growth of the sector.But this hasn’t affected everyone equally. Perpetual Protocol, another perpetual futures DEX, is still watching its open interest grow.“I think the challenge is that there were not many new crypto traders coming to DEXs post-FTX fallout,” its co-founder, Yenwen, told CoinDesk in an email. “But I remain optimistic and believe that derivatives DEXs will become the key players for the next bull run.”4:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(8:00 UTC) Germany IFO - Business Climate (March)1:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(17:00 UTC) Bank of England's Governor Bailey Speech5:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(21:00 UTC) Fed's Jefferson SpeechIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Do Kwon Charged With Fraud by U.S. Prosecutors; Binance Temporarily Pauses Spot TradingFederal prosecutors in New York are charging Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon with fraud after he was arrested by police in Montenegro.

17,"The hacker behind Euler Finance’s $200 million exploit earlier this month returned a majority of the stolen funds to the protocol Saturday.Euler's native EUL tokens were up 25% in the past 24 hours, with the majority of the move coming after the hacker returned tokens to the protocol, which may have fueled positive sentiment among traders.Data from blockchain explorer Etherscan shows over 51,000 ether, valued at nearly $90 million as of Saturday, was sent back to the Euler deployer contract in early U.S. hours.However, the exploiter made several other transactions that transferred tens of millions of dai stablecoins to another wallet, blockchain data shows.Last week, Euler put out a $1 million bounty offer for the hacker to return the stolen funds. Developers asked for 90% of the stolen funds to be returned at the time.The lending protocol suffered an exploit earlier this month that resulted in almost $200 million being lost over four transactions in dai (DAI), wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), staked ether (sETH) and USD coin (USDC).The attacker used a flash loan to conduct the attack by temporarily tricking the protocol into falsely assuming it held varying amounts of eToken and dToken, as CoinDesk explained."
18,"Narratives among crypto bulls are ephemeral except one: Bitcoin (BTC) is an antidote to unconventional Federal Reserve monetary policies.It has recently reached a fever pitch on Crypto Twitter, thanks to venture capitalist and angel investor Balaji Srinivasan saying he'd wager that bitcoin will hit the $1 million mark within 90 days. The former Coinbase chief technology officer also predicted a U.S. banking crisis ​​that would crash the dollar and spur hyperinflation – an excessively fast rise in the price of goods and services. The U.S. dollar, the de facto global reserve currency, has yet to suffer through this type of extreme devaluation.Balaji's prediction follows the Fed opening liquidity taps in the form of dollar lending programs to contain the banking sector instability in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB) collapse. Similar forecasts predicting Weimar Republic-style U.S. hyperinflation made plenty of noise following the covid-spurred crash of March 2020 and the 2008 global meltdown. On both occasions, the Fed poured trillions of dollars into the system through outright asset purchases, or quantitative easing (QE).Hyperinflation almost always results from a large amount of money ""chasing"" the same amount of goods and services being supplied in an economy. In other words, the money created through QE or other measures must be spent on the stagnant stock of goods and services to boost inflation. Assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies can hyperinflate in terms of valuations if the newly created money enters financial markets instead of the real economy (as it did following the 2008 and 2020 crashes).The Fed's latest measure – the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) – is not QE, even though it has caused a QE-style expansion of the Fed's balance sheet.""There's a lot of confusion and hyperbole out there about the implications of U.S. government measures to stem the banking turmoil. It's not QE [quantitative easing] and while inflation will remain sticky, it won't be hyperinflation,"" Martha Reyes, a member of the advisory council at the Digital Economy Initiative, told CoinDesk.In QE, the Fed snaps up Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities from financial institutions with no pre-defined holding period. When the Fed purchases bonds from a bank, the latter's cash reserves at the central bank rise, providing it with a liquidity cushion and greater incentive to lend. Increased lending then encourages more spending and investment, putting upward pressure on prices either in the real economy or asset markets.Under the BTFP, the Fed is loaning money to banks to allow them to meet their immediate financial obligations. Banks need liquidity to service the deposit flight seen after large interest rate hikes by the Fed. A liquidity shortage can lead to widespread bank runs, a catastrophic outcome.The borrowing banks have to return the money after a year along with the interest rate charged as per overnight index swap (OIS) rate plus 10 basis points. It's not free money like QE!""BTFP is not QE. It is a program to help stabilize banking liquidity. This new BTFP program will allow banks to pledge [Treasurys] or mortgages in return for immediate liquidity for up to one year. It is a liquidity program available in times of stress and is short term,” emerging markets trader and analyst Seng Liew said in a LinkedIn post.""Conventional vanilla banking is about the mismatch between deposits and assets. In SVB's case, they had deposit redemptions of $42 [billion], which is just over 20% of the bank assets when Silicon Valley deserted them in one day. That caused the failure, not the investment in the assets. Since the [COVID-19] pandemic, corporate loan growth has been mediocre away from the huge increase under the PPP loan program. Hence, most banks invested the bulk of their liquidity in U.S. [Treasurys] and mortgages,"" Liew added.In other words, the money received from the Fed in the form of loans through BTFP or other programs like the discount window is unlikely to be used in a way that will lead to stimulus in the economy or financial markets.“QE is increasing the balance sheet for monetary purposes. This is about financial stability, and all expansion of the balance sheet is not QE,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and author of “Making Sense of the Dollar,"" told CoinDesk in an email.Hyperinflation predicted by Balaji can also materialize through a sharp, sudden devaluation of the greenback. Currency devaluation imports inflation from abroad, raising the general price level in the economy.History, however, tells us that investors tend to flock into the dollar-denominated assets during times of stress, including those caused by stateside issues.The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s value against major currencies, surged by 11% in the second half of 2008 even as Lehman Brothers collapsed, causing a worldwide contagion. The index stabilized in the range of 75 to 90 in the subsequent years, even though the Fed did multiple rounds of QE. The dollar slipped 11% in 10 months after the Fed reopened liquidity floodgates in March 2020, a notable devaluation but far from the outright hyperinflationary crash.“In the event of a widespread banking panic, which seems unlikely at this time, there will probably be the typical rush by investors into safe assets such as the U.S. Treasury securities. That is likely to help than hurt the dollar in the short term,” Eswar Prasad, professor at Cornell University, told CoinDesk, calling the hyperinflation forecasts “unduly hyperbolic.”“It will be interesting to see if the narrative of crypto being perceived by investors as a safer asset than fiat currency holds up if the current turmoil in the banking system intensifies,” Prasad added.A full-blown banking crisis, as predicted by Balaji, can actually cause a credit freeze, as observed after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, and lead to deflation – a general decline in prices for goods and services, typically associated with a contraction in the supply of money and credit in the economy. Deflation usually boosts demand for cash.Banks are more likely to keep the money borrowed from the Fed with them to ensure healthy liquidity levels instead of lending it out.Credit freeze refers to a situation in which international interbank markets freeze and interbank lending beyond very short maturities virtually evaporates, cutting the supply of liquidity to households and businesses.""Loans to illiquid institutions are lifelines, pure triage that cannot escape the banking system and manifest as velocity. They slow the economy as lending at these banks freezes,"" Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO of Quill Intelligence LLC, tweeted.Despite the obvious differences between QE and BTFP and the deflationary impact of an outright banking sector crisis, many in the market are expecting rapid price gains in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has rallied over 40% in two weeks.Perhaps the disconnect from obvious reality results from Pavlovian conditioning – the behavioral and physiological changes brought about by experiencing a predictive relationship between a neutral stimulus (ultra-easy monetary policy since 2008) and a consequent biologically significant event (surge in risk assets).Interest rates were stuck at or below zero for the most part between 2008 and 2021, barring the Fed's minor tightening cycle that saw rates rise by 225 basis points between December 2015 and December 2018. Besides, most central banks, including the Fed, embarked on multiple rounds of quantitative easing.The prolonged easing bias has permanently paired the neutral stimuli and the consequent event in the minds of investors. As such, every Fed move is either being misread as QE or an advance indicator of an eventual launch of QE.Lyllah Ledesma contributed reporting to this article."
19,"If you looked at the price of digital assets seven days ago, promised yourself to not look again until a week passed and then looked at their prices Thursday, you’d likely think that nothing significant had occurred.Bitcoin and ether prices changed only mildly, with BTC down 0.57% and ETH down 2.52%. Trading activity was orderly, with overall volume trailing the 20-day moving average for both assets.This week was anything but uneventful, however, with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcing another interest rate hike, the banking industry trying to avert a meltdown and U.S. regulators ratcheting up their scrutiny of the crypto industry.Even the Biden administration was viewing the crypto industry more sharply this week. Its “Economic Report of the President” led with comments that the design of crypto assets “frequently reflects an ignorance of basic economic principles that have been learned in economics and finance over centuries, and this inadequate design is often detrimental to consumers and investors.”Still, much of the economic turmoil this week is tied to the bond portfolios of traditional banking institutions. Those bond values have declined sharply following the most rapid increase of interest rates in history.The Federal Open Market Committee ultimately raised interest rates by 25 basis points as expected, and said that it expects to continue doing so as inflation, the result partly of a two-year long, 0% interest rate environment, remains too high.FOMC raised its Core PCE inflation estimates for 2023 to 3.3% from 3.1%, but the ultimate interest rate projection of 5.1% remains.Among crypto assets with market capitalizations of $1 billion or more, BTC and ETH were eighth and 14th, respectively, in this week’s CoinDesk Indices price performance chart.XRP led the group rising 11.1%, while immutable X (IMX) and its 27.7% decline was the laggard. Looking ahead to next week, key points on the economic calendar include the quarterly GDP data on March 30, and core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data on March 31.Investors’ focus may also shift to whether BTC and ETH retrace to their 20-day moving averages or ascend higher. Another key item to watch is whether ether will gain ground versus bitcoin.Year to date, ETH has underperformed BTC by 12%, despite their traditionally tight correlation."
